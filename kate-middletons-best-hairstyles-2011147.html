From bouncy blowouts to perfect ponytails, Princess Kate is known for her luscious locks.
The British royal has some seriously shiny strands. Since stepping into the spotlight, her tresses were all anyone could talk about. Because whether she is rocking loose waves or bangs, the princess has a good hair day, every day.
The Hold Still author’s signature look is waves and a side part, but following her wedding — where she wore her hair in a demure half-up half-down style – she switched things up a bit with face-framing layers."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Somewhere along the way, she switched over to a center part, staying true to current trends.</p><p>While her hair is down the majority of the time, Kate has donned her fair share of updos. And let Us just say: they never disappoint.</p><p>Take her 2012 tour of Malaysia for example. The royal had quite the intricate chignon, complete with pearls pinned into the loops. She also donned a gorgeous ballerina bun for a reception at the Government House in Australia in 2014.</p><p>The former duchess went on to rock longer locks, considering getting a haircut during the COVID-19 pandemic wasn’t all too easy.
