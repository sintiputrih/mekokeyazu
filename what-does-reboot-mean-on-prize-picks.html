So, ahead of the <a href=#>Cincinnati Bengals</a> primetime game against the <a href=#>Baltimore Ravens</a> on Thursday, Nov. 16, 2023, some users may have selected superstar quarterback <a href=#>Joe Burrow</a> and predicted he would throw for more than 155.5 passing yards.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>However, the Bengals leader left his team in the second quarter after a four-yard touchdown throw to running back <a href=#>Joe Mixon</a>. He fell on his right wrist earlier in the game and didn't touch the field for the rest of the night.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Now, since Joe exited the game in the first half and never returned, it triggered a "Reboot" for everyone who picked him. The entry went down a notch — like from a six pick to a five pick, and so on — and the Joe Burrow square was treated as if it were a DNP (Did Not Play). In other words, "Reboot" essentially means that the pick didn't count.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIydpp6rXaeyo7vOrWSmnZGjerC6jKmporKVYr2qr8qs</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
