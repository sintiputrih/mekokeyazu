He chose to use his middle name as his stage name. He was born in Phoenix, Arizona, but he moved around a lot for school. For college, he started at the University of Vermont. After a year, he transferred to Vanderbilt University in Nashville, which he graduated from in 1997.</p><p>Following college, Bentley began working at The Nashville Network, which is now known as Paramount Network. His job was to research old footage of country performances. He was banned from the Grand Ole Opry after he trespassed for what he claimed was research purposes. The ban was lifted when Bentley released his first studio album, Dierks Bentley in 2003.</p><h2 id=dierks-bentley-married-his-middle-school-sweetheart><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Dierks Bentley Married His Middle School Sweetheart</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/woc-8-3-1056x704.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dierks Bentley and his wife Cassidy Black have a very sweet love story. They first met in 8th grade at Phoenix’s Ingleside Middle School. “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I had a crush on her the whole time, but I wasn’t cool enough</a>,” Bentley recalled to People in 2007. “I was way too immature and into drinking beer and guns and blowing things up.” Black agrees, claiming “he was just trouble” at the time. They attempted to date in high school, but things went awry when distance separated them. Bentley moved to Nashville, and Black moved to San Francisco.</p><p>“I used to write her all these crazy love letters that I’d FedExed out to her,” Bentley said of their long-distance relationship. “That’s why I married her! I was worried I’d get blackmailed with those letters!” Black still has every letter her husband wrote her. The two tied the knot in 2005 in a beautiful ceremony in Mexico. They now live in Nashville with their three children and dog George.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Walker Hayes Almost Quit Country Music For This Relatable Reason</a></span></p><h2 id=dierks-bentley-rsquo-s-early-days-in-country-music><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Dierks Bentley’s Early Days In Country Music</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image.jpeg><p>Dierks Bentley came in hot with his first album. Dierks Bentley was released in 2003 by Capitol Nashville, and the single “What Was I Thinking” reached number one on the <a href=#>Billboard Hot Country Songs chart</a>. While other singers struggle at the beginning of their careers in the music industry, Bentley found success early and has continued to maintain that success throughout his career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His second album Modern Day Drifter, which came out in 2005, was also very well received.

The singer allowed fans to choose songs for the album.

The band was originally formed by Bentley in 2015. The band released its debut album in 2015 called The K Is Silent, and they have not released any music since. Bentley produced the album, and it was released by Capitol Records. He is also the lead singer of the Hot Country Knights, but he performs under the alter-ego Douglas “Doug” Douglasson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The band itself and the album The K Is Silent is a parody of country music, specifically country music from the 1990s. The satirical tribute band is comprised of Bentley’s actual road band. The single “Pick Her Up” featured country music singer Travis Tritt. The band and the album received great reviews by critics, but they have not announced any plans to release a follow-up album.</p><h2 id=dierks-bentley-involves-his-family-in-his-music><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Dierks Bentley Involves His Family In His Music</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/db-robbykein-1673546441.jpg><p>Dierks Bentley is first and foremost a family man.

During that time, he has released ten studio albums, an album with the band Hot Country Knights, and an EP which he financed himself. Already that is an insane amount of music to have created, but Bentley has revealed that he often writes way more songs than what makes the cut of an album. Fans want Bentley to take a page out of Taylor Swift’s playbook and release these vault songs.</p><p>Bentley’s tenth studio album Gravel & Gold was released on February 24th, 2023. In preparation for the album, the country music singer released the single “Gold” on July 29th, 2022.
