If the sisters are seen eating anything on screen, it's almost always a mix of greens in a clear plastic container (apparently, the clear plastic container is key). Kim Kardashian has even&nbsp;spoken at length about her favorite salads from her hit reality show, according to <a href=#>People</a>. It's a thing, and it's definitely a thing in Kylie Jenner's "A Day in the Life."</p><p>When we <a href=#>first encounter</a>&nbsp;Kris Jenner in the video, she's eating a "Chinese chicken salad," which her youngest daughter thinks look delicious. However, we'd be remiss to not mention that the proud momager is basically all of our moms in this moment, as she goes on to call a vlog a "glog." (This is pretty reminiscent of that time our parents first discovered iCloud ... unfortunately, this cannot be erased from memory.)&nbsp;</p><p>Salad has its second cameo during the Jenner sisters' collaboration meeting. At about 11:30 a.m., the video's titular star is&nbsp;<a href=#>pictured eating</a> for the first time that day, so she's either starving or the Illuminati has given her the secret to everlasting life without sustenance. While the table is littered with clear plastic containers carrying various salads, CEO Kylie is served first because she's a total boss, but her salad looks like a huge upgrade compared to what everyone else is eating.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmam1kbYV1e9KmmKWkXZmyta3Ipapmr5Viu7DAyJycnWWZo3qsxcuinGailaO7pr6MmmSdmalitq9506GcZqSZm7Jw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
