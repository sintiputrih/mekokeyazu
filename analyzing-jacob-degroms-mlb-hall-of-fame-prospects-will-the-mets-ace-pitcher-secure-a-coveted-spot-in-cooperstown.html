DeGrom's Career So Far Jacob deGrom was drafted by the New York Mets in the ninth round of the 2010 MLB Draft out of Stetson University, and he took four years to reach the Majors."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

While his achievements so far are impressive, there are still questions about whether he has done enough to secure a place in Cooperstown. In this article, we will analyze deGrom's career and his chances of being inducted into the Hall of Fame.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>DeGrom's Career So Far Jacob deGrom was drafted by the New York Mets in the ninth round of the 2010 MLB Draft out of Stetson University, and he took four years to reach the Majors. He made his debut in 2014 and won the National League Rookie of the Year Award that season. DeGrom followed up his impressive rookie year with consecutive NL Cy Young Awards in 2018-19, cementing his status as one of the best pitchers in the game.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>DeGrom's Statistics When looking at deGrom's statistics, it becomes clear that he is a special talent. Since 2018, he has the highest Wins Above Replacement (WAR) among pitchers, and his career ERA and ERA+ are comparable to those of Hall of Famers like Lefty Grove, Bob Gibson, and Randy Johnson. His current hot streak is also impressive, with a 0.31 ERA and a strikeout rate of 49.5 percent.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>However, there are some concerns about deGrom's overall numbers. His career bWAR and JAWS are lower than the average for Hall of Famers. Additionally, deGrom's late start in the league at 25 years old may hinder his chances of being inducted into the Hall of Fame. Only 10 starting pitchers who debuted in their age-25 season or later have been enshrined in Cooperstown, with nine having debuted before integration. DeGrom needs another 37.8 WAR to reach the average among Hall of Fame starting pitchers (73.3) and is still about halfway to 2,500 K’s.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Comparisons to Other Hall of Fame Pitchers Comparisons to other Hall of Fame pitchers like Sandy Koufax and Dizzy Dean are also inconclusive because of differences in their careers. Koufax, for example, had a shorter career than deGrom but was dominant during his peak years, winning three Cy Young Awards and retiring with a 165-87 record and a 2.76 ERA. Dean, on the other hand, had a longer career than deGrom but struggled with injuries and had a shorter peak. He retired with a 150-83 record and a 3.02 ERA.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>DeGrom's Hall of Fame Prospects Given deGrom's impressive statistics and performances, it is clear that he is a legitimate Hall of Fame candidate. However, his spot in Cooperstown is not secure because he has not yet met the minimum requirement of 10 years in the league. Additionally, his late start and shorter career may hurt his chances of being inducted into the Hall of Fame.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Winning another Cy Young Award could be the quickest way for deGrom to cement his place in Cooperstown. However, even if he doesn't win another award, his success is not to be taken lightly. His current hot streak and overall impressive career make him a serious contender for the Hall of Fame.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Jacob deGrom's MLB Hall of Fame prospects are complicated due to his late start and shorter career so far. However, his impressive statistics and performances make him a legitimate candidate for the Hall of Fame. Winning another Cy Young Award could be the quickest way for him to secure a place in Cooperstown, but even if he doesn't win another award, his success is not to be taken lightly. In the end, only time will tell if deGrom will join the ranks of the greatest pitchers in baseball history.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6apZqkqa%2B2r7OMo5icp5Jisaaz0aikrGWdoa9utMClo2anlmKzornEZqerp6OlsqTA0mauoqScYsGpsYymnK2rXZawpnnPoqucoJWnerSxwq6pnmWRYrCwwsStnJ1lo6W8tXnIp2Scp5%2BlsrO%2F06iupw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
