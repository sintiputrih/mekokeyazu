I love you so much! God bless you🎂🎉😘❤️🙏🥰,” Lindsay, 37, captioned a carousel of <a href=# rel=noopener>photos</a> with Ali, 30, to celebrate her little sis’ big day on Friday, December 22. One snapshot was a smiling selfie of the two while another pic showed the bikini-clad sisters sitting in a pool together.</p><p>In addition to the sisters hanging out together frequently, Ali has also developed a bond with Lindsay’s husband, <strong>Bader Shammas</strong>, whom she married in April 2022. The couple share son Luai, 5 months.</p><p>Ali posted two photo booth picture strips via Instagram on December 8 that showed a slew of goofy snaps with Lindsay and Shammas, 36. “Grateful,” she captioned the <a href=# rel=noopener>post</a> as Lindsay responded with a red heart emoji.</p><p>Despite Lindsay being in the spotlight most of her life as a child actor who later found success as an adult, Ali said she “never felt” like she was in her famous sister’s “shadow.”</p><p>“I would’ve been doing this with or without my sister being Lindsay Lohan,” Ali, who is now a singer, told <a href=# rel=noopener>People</a> in July. “And Lindsay knows that, and Lindsay would’ve been doing this with or without me being her sister. We grew up with it around us.”</p><p>That being said, Ali was drawn to her career in part because of Lindsay, explaining, “I felt like I was always just born to do this. … I grew up on set my whole life, watching my big sister be a superstar and make it look so effortless.”</p><p>Ali isn’t totally in the dark about Lindsay’s life experiences as she also got her start at a very young age, recording her first album, Lohan Holiday, at just 9 years old. Since then, the sisters appeared on-screen together for the Netflix film Falling for Christmas in November 2022.</p><p>“Working with Lindsay was incredible,” Ali, who also contributed several songs to the soundtrack, previously told People. “Having done a Christmas album, to be able to have my music in a Christmas movie was just very full circle. Even to my kids in the future, it’ll be so cool to say, ‘Mommy did a song in her sister’s film and was able to act with her.’ I don’t really have many words. I’m just so grateful.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite living in Dubai, Lindsay said she is still “so tight” with her family while dishing details about her family group chat, which includes Ali, their mom, <strong>Dina</strong>, and their brothers, <strong>Michael</strong> and <strong>Cody</strong>.</p><p>“We’re in a family group chat and we just talk every single day about everything,” the Mean Girls actress said. “We’re all best friends — my brothers, my sister, they’re my best friends. It’s the best. It’s what makes you stronger, also, as women in the world, [knowing] that you have your crew behind you.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaloZ6ZwKLFjKWmoZmeYsCprdGeqmaqkaeybrzHqKuoZaeewal50qKqrZ2iYq6ttYyfpqtlmJq%2Fbq7Iq6uhnJGufA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
