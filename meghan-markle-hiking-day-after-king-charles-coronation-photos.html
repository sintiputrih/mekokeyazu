Her hair was also pulled up under her hat and she accessorized with various jewelry, including bracelet and the&nbsp;<strong>Maya Brenner</strong> x<strong> Abigail Spencer</strong> ‘The Clarity Retreat Necklace’ designed by her close pal Abigail, who she appeared with on Suits. She seemed to be engaged in a conversation with her friends, who were <strong>Markus Anderson</strong> and <strong>Heather Dorak</strong>, and at one point, took her jacket off and tied it around her waist, revealing her toned arms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/meghan-markle-hike-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Meghan’s husband, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Prince Harry</strong></a>, 38, didn’t appear to be on the hike with her. He may have been at home with their kids, Archie, and <strong>Princess Lilibet</strong>, 1, since he flew straight <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>back to the states</a> after the coronation ceremony yesterday. It’s believed he arrived back in time to celebrate the later part of Archie’s birthday with him.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The Duke of Sussex <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>made headlines</a> on Saturday, when he arrived at Westminster Abbey to see his father and stepmother, <strong>Camilla Parker Bowles</strong>, officially crowned King and Queen of the United Kingdom. He sat in the third row of the church and didn’t appear to interact with his father or his brother, <strong>Prince William</strong> and his family, in front of the cameras. He did flash many smiles throughout the big event, however, and was later seen getting into a car to make his way back to his California home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/meghan-markle-harry-spl-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>On the same day Meghan was seen hiking, the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>coronation concert</a> happened.
