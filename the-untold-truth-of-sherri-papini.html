In the spring of 2017, investigators found male <a href=#>DNA</a> on the clothing and underwear she wore when she was discovered, but it wasn't until 2019 that the DNA was decoded. The following year, the DNA led them to Papini's ex-boyfriend, who was living in an apartment in Costa Mesa, California. The ex-boyfriend told investigators that Papini's story had been a lie; in fact, he helped her leave her home and drove her to his apartment. Papini told him that her husband, Keith Papini, was abusive, and she needed to escape, per <a href=#>People</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>Papini's entire abduction was deliberately plotted — she and the ex-boyfriend contacted each other over pre-paid phones to solidify their plans ahead of time. According to the <a href=#>criminal complaint</a> filed against Papini, she and her ex-boyfriend started talking as early as December 2015. Once she arrived at her ex-boyfriend's home, she lived a comfortable life and never left the apartment. The ex-boyfriend bought her clothes at TJ Maxx, Target, and Ross, and she slept in a bedroom while the ex-boyfriend slept on a couch. As <a href=#>Thanksgiving</a> neared, Papini said she missed her children and requested to be returned home, even though the ex-boyfriend assumed she would stay longer.</p><p dir=ltr>If you or someone you know is dealing with domestic abuse, you can call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1−800−799−7233. You can also find more information, resources, and support at <a href=#>their website</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCEknJqbXFfqbWmedSnq6iklGLBs8HToWSonl2otaa%2B0aJkqZmgnruqew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
