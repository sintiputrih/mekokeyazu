He gained recognition as a director of the FaZe team and achieved fame through his involvement in playing the video game Call of Duty. He has also established his own channel, FaZe Blaze, which has garnered close to three million subscribers.</p><p>Have you ever wondered about the wealth of FaZe Blaziken? According to reliable sources, his net worth is estimated to be $800,000 as of late 2017, a sum accumulated through his successful career starting from 2013.</p><h3>FaZe Blaziken Net Worth $800,000</h3><p>Blaziken grew up in Vienna alongside his sister Mia, who shares his passion for Call of Duty. His affinity for video games developed at an early age and intensified during his teenage years, leading to the creation of the YouTube channel FaZe Blaze. His initial video, “TheUWPolar AoN Montage – Edited by Me,” was uploaded on January 8, 2013, marking the inception of his channel. Since then, Blaziken has become a prominent figure in the online gaming community. His popularity surged, and he was eventually noticed by other YouTubers who invited him to join the FaZe Clan, a team of YouTubers competing in Call of Duty events. This opportunity led Blaziken to relocate to New York and become the director of the renowned Call of Duty team. The team comprises popular YouTubers such as FaZe Apex, FaZe Adapt, FaZe Rain, FaZe Censor, and FaZe Rug, alongside other members who are less known on YouTube. In recent years, they have expanded their interests to include other games such as Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Overwatch.</p><p>The success of Team FaZe contributed to Blaziken’s wealth, but his primary source of income is his own YouTube channel, which has amassed over three million subscribers and more than 420 million views, significantly enhancing his net worth.</p><p>Recently, FaZe Blaziken ventured into the music industry by releasing the song “Woah Kemosabe,” featuring RSK. The video has garnered over six million views and stands as one of the most popular videos on his channel.</p><p>Regrettably, very little information is available about Blaziken’s personal life as he prefers to keep it private. At just 21 years old, he has his romantic adventures ahead of him.</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$800,000</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>August 19, 1996</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Vienna, Austria</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Youtuber</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Austrian</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Mia</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=#>https://twitter.com/FaZeBlaziken?lang=en</a></td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td>https://www.instagram.com/blazifyy/?hl=en</td></tr></tbody></table><p><br></p><p><br><br></p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmidmrKVYq%2Btrdmiop6mXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
