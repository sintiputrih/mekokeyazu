Little did she know, <a href=#>her nude scenes would later inspire Halle Berry</a> to do a $40 million movie. But recently, the Expats star has been drawing flak for not "looking her age."</p><p>Internet critics have called her out for wearing "young" outfits. She's also accused of getting work done because of her latest "unrecognizable" photos. The actress has addressed the speculations before, just as how <strong><a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a></strong> has <a href=#>admitted to getting certain cosmetic procedures</a>. Here's what the experts have said about Kidman's plastic surgery rumors.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/leah-remini-called-nicole-kidman-her-_guardian-angel_-against-scientology-despite-never-meeting-the-actress-front-back_deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Leah Remini Called Nicole Kidman Her "Guardian Angel" Against Scientology Despite Never Meeting The Actress</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Leah Remini had a special connection to Nicole Kidman, and one very few knew about.</span><h2 id=nicole-kidman-had-many-quot-fears-and-insecurities-quot-about-her-height-as-a-teen>Nicole Kidman Had Many "Fears And Insecurities" About Her Height As A Teen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/instar29706315.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In November 2020, amid the backlash about Kidman's "unrecognizable" appearance, the actress opened up <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her "fears and insecurities" as a teen</a>. "I was a teenager who wouldn't conform, but I had a lot of fears and insecurities because I was very tall. I was 5ft10in' by the time I was 13 years old," she told Glamour UK while promoting her <strong><a href=#>Netflix</a></strong> musical, The Prom.</p><p>She went into detail four years later, telling Radio Times podcast that her height would "bother" her whenever she needed "to be small" for a part. "I was teased. I was called 'Stalky.' They'd always be like, 'How’s the air up there?'" she shared. "'You're so much taller than I thought,' is what I get. And then sort of grappling with how high my heels should be."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She continued: "Whenever you go on the red carpet, they send the shoes and the shoes are always so high. And I'm like, 'Do they have a kitten heel? No.'" She had then resigned to the fact that she was just "going to be the tallest person, the giraffe." And it got in the way of some roles. But she's eventually come to "appreciate" her height and "use this" in acting when it's "related" to the job.</p><p>"Yes. I was told, 'You won’t have a career. You're too tall."</p><p>At the end of the day, "none of it matters" for Kidman who believes: "What does matter is how you allow other people to either say 'Yes' or 'No' to you, and whether you accept that. That inner resilience as a human being, that's the superpower, really. Above all superpowers."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Being tall certainly has its good and bad. Unfortunately, for the Bombshell star, that also includes health issues. "Hey, I'm incredibly grateful to be healthy and walking around," she added. "I mean with that said, I've had knee issues and all sorts of things, partly because of my height."</p><p>Nicole Kidman was glad she "can wear heels now" following <a href=#>her 2003 divorce</a> from <strong><a href=#>Tom Cruise</a></strong> , who's only 5ft7in.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/these-nicole-kidman-movies-have-grossed-over-100-million-at-the-box-office-3.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>These Nicole Kidman Movies Have Grossed Over $100 Million At The Box Office</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>While Kidman has been working more with TV series than movies as of late, her most recent film has already brought in over $375 million worldwide.</span><h2 id=plastic-surgeons-believe-nicole-kidman-has-had-several-cosmetic-procedures>Plastic Surgeons Believe Nicole Kidman Has Had Several Cosmetic Procedures</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/nn.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2018, MYA – an Aesthetic/Cosmetic Surgery Consultation and Treatment service – published an article about their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">assessment of Kidman's beauty evolution</a>. After seeing that year's The Undoing starring the actress, MYA wrote: "Nicole's eyes appear brighter and her eyebrows slightly lifted, this usually points towards the non-surgical treatment of anti-wrinkle injections (also known as Botox)," which "most likely had... to her forehead, glabella (in between the eyebrows) and eyes (crow's feet)."</p><p>"[Kidman] appears to have a smooth forehead, lifted eyebrow arches and a limited frown/expression."</p><p>The Oscar winner might have also had a nose job, according to the cosmetic service group. "Looking back at images of the 53 year old over the years, we believe that Nicole may have had a Rhinoplasty procedure (the surgical name for nose reshaping surgery) - the bridge of her nose appears thinner, and the tip and nostrils appear to be smaller and slightly lifted compared to previous images," they said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>MYA also believes that Kidman "may have had the non-surgical treatment of Dermal Fillers to her cheeks often referred to as 'cheek fillers.'" They said "recent images of Nicole suggest she may have undergone the non-surgical treatment of fillers to her lips as she appears to have slightly fuller lips compared to previous images."</p><p>While none of these were confirmed by Kidman, she's proud of her drastic physical transformations onscreen.

"To be honest, I am completely natural I have nothing in my face or anything," she said at that time. "I wear sunscreen, and I don’t smoke. I take care of myself. And I'm very proud to say that."
