“A typical holiday dinner alone can carry a load of 3,000 calories,” the Calorie Control Council (CCC), an association representing the reduced-calorie food and beverage industry says, noting that “many nibble through another 1,500 calories, downing appetizers and drinks before and after the big meal.”
The CCC says a normal Thanksgiving meal has 3,150 calories and 159 grams of fat."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That includes some appetizers, turkey, several side dishes, a glass of sweet tea, a slice of pecan pie and the use of a tablespoon of butter.</p><p>There have also been lower-calorie estimates. Looking at a different assortment of dishes and portion sizes, <a href=#>the New York Times reported in 2012</a> that a Thanksgiving meal contains 2,486 calories. That figure didn’t include any beverages.</p><p>However, the calories in your Turkey Day dinner be much higher than either estimate.</p><p>“It ranges, but on average anywhere from 3,000 to 4,500 calories,” <a href=#>dietitian Tanya Zuckerbrot</a>, MS, RD, told Fox News. That range is just for the Thanksgiving meal and desserts — and doesn’t include cocktails or appetizers, she explained.</p><p>If these amounts seem steep, Zuckerbrot had several options for a lower-calorie Thanksgiving meal. Those include:</p><ul><li>6 ounces of white, skinless turkey (220 calories and 6 grams of fat) instead of 6 ounces of dark meat turkey with skin (374 calories and 12 grams of fat)</li><li>1 cup of mashed cauliflower (60 calories) instead of 1 cup of regular mashed potatoes (237 calories)</li><li>1/2 cup of baked sweet potato (80 calories) over 1 cup sweet potatoes with marshmallows (610 calories)</li></ul><p>When it comes to dessert, she recommended “going topless” and picking a slice of pumpkin pie, which doesn’t have a top crust. A pumpkin pie slice has 316 calories, versus 526 calories in a slice of pecan pie and 436 calories in a double-crust slice of apple pie, according to Zuckerbrot.</p><p>Another one of her hacks? Treat Thanksgiving like a regular dinner.</p><p>“Don’t walk in ravenous. Have your breakfast and have your lunch,” she said. Eating lunch, she said, offsets an inclination to later overeat during the big meal.</p><p>She also recommended people bring a low-calorie appetizer instead of an entree, and to also help out the hostess.</p><p>That way, Zuckerbrot said, you can “keep hands busy and away from the buffet.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlfnh7kGpmam5frry2voytn5qmm6i0qsLIp55mpZWWuW610mauqKqknXq0sdWeqZqkXZmuur%2BMqJ1mm5GhvLO1xKxm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
