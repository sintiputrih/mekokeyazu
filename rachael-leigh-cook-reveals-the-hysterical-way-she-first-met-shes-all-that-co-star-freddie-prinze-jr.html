The first time I met Freddie was in Sundance,” <strong>Rachael</strong> shared with <a href=#>E!</a>. “We were both in House of Yes and I was in a house that he and Parker [Posey] and Josh [Hamilton] and everybody were in just saying hello to everybody.”</p><p>“I was standing in the living room and I felt these giant arms just throw themselves around me and hug me and rest a chin on top of my head,” <strong>Rachael</strong> continued. “And it was Freddie and he just goes, ‘Hey babe.’ I looked up and he screamed a little because he thought I was [his then-girlfriend] Kimberly [McCullough]. He didn’t know that it was me because why would you? We had the exact same frame and hair color. So it was a pretty hilarious, romantic-comedy first meeting that obviously never became a real romance, but it was pretty funny.”</p><p>After the movie was released, <strong>Rachael</strong> and <strong>Freddie</strong> lost touch for years, but reconnected after their co-star <a href=# title="Paul Walker"><strong>Paul Walker</strong></a> died in 2013 in a car accident.</p><p>“He’s just such a wonderful human. I just love that guy,” <strong>Rachael</strong> added about <strong>Freddie</strong>. “But I probably didn’t talk to him again until a couple of years after Pauldied and realized you really have to reach out and take some initiative.</p><p>She added, “So we got coffee and I remember saying to him, ‘I know we never really hung out very much after the shoot, but you have no idea what a big part of my life this ended up being.’ And he said something very Freddie-like, ‘Me too, dude. It’s crazy.’ But I’m so lucky that it’s someone as charming and as lovely as Freddie to share that with.”</p><p>In He’s All That, <strong>Rachael</strong> reprised her role as Laney, mom to <a href=# title="Addison Rae"><strong>Addison Rae</strong></a>‘s lead character Padgett.
