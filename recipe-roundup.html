Early on, this surprised me, because eggplant recipes have always been some of my favorite foods to eat. As a kid, I never wanted to stop playing at dinnertime, except when my mom was making eggplant Parmesan. And when I started to explore vegetarian cooking on my own, grilled eggplant was one of the first dishes I mastered. But if I’ve learned one thing through writing Love and Lemons, it’s that not everyone likes eggplant. I’ve heard it called spongy, bitter, and bland, and to that I…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Salad recipes are my favorite way to showcase vibrant, in-season produce—fruits and veggies that taste so good on their own that it doesn’t take much to make them into a delicious meal. On cold winter nights, I like to brighten up our table with a colorful mix of root veggies and hearty greens. On beautiful, warm days when I’d rather be outside than in the kitchen, summer salads are the perfect lunch or dinner: they’re simple to toss together, but they’re super flavorful nonetheless.

Here in Chicago, radishes are some of the first vegetables to pop up at the farmers markets. Every year, I eagerly wait for them to appear. And when they finally do, I fill my bag with as many bunches of them as I can carry. What can I say? I just can’t resist their peppery pink roots and lush greens. Luckily, when I bring them home, I have no shortage of ways to use them. Of course, I can munch on them raw, but I can also roast them, pickle…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Jack and I always have a carton of eggs in our fridge. And if you eat eggs, there’s a good chance you do too. I mean, why not? They’re quick to prepare, satisfying, and rich in protein, and they’re at home at almost any meal.&nbsp;Whip up a simple scramble for breakfast or shakshuka for dinner, or soft-boil an egg for a boost of protein at lunch. If you happen to be cooking for a special occasion (maybe Easter or Mother’s Day brunch?), egg recipes can come in handy then too. A frittata or breakfast casserole would make a great main…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If I don’t have a stockpile of healthy snacks on hand, I will, without fail, reach for a cookie at 3pm. Now, there’s nothing wrong with treating yourself to something sweet in the afternoon, but if I’m working on a new&nbsp;cookie recipe, there’s a good chance that snacking on sweets will become less of a treat and more of a habit. Over the years, I’ve learned that filling up on healthy snacks like veggies and dip, smoothies, or trail mix will only make those sweets more rewarding in the end. I’ll be more energized and focused throughout the day, my…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>On a weekend morning, I love starting my day with a stack of healthy pancakes. Pancakes, because it’s the weekend. And healthy (or healthy-ish), because they leave me feeling satisfied, energized, and ready to take on the day. You’ll find my go-to healthy pancake recipes in the post below. Some showcase fresh fruit, others call for whole grain flour, and still others are made without grains at all. They’re all similar in that they rely on simple, wholesome ingredients, they’re easy to mix together, and they’re absolutely delicious.

Sure, they’re made without meat, cheese, or cream, but they still deliver everything you want from a big bowl of pasta. Bold flavors, chewy, al dente noodles, maybe a creamy sauce or tangy marinara. Even Jack, our resident meat and cheese lover, will go back for seconds – even thirds – of these vegan pasta recipes.

When it comes to pizza toppings, I certainly have a few favorites (I’ll always use fresh basil, roasted tomatoes, and artichoke hearts if I have them on hand), but what I love most is coming up with new pizza topping ideas that I haven’t tried before. Butternut squash and sage? Yes, please. Fennel, mushroom, and tarragon? Delicious! Grilled pineapple and pickled jalapeño? Bring it on.
