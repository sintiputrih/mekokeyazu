The Sunday, December 20, episode of <i>The Real Housewives of Atlanta </i>opened with the ladies kicking back with four new men, including one who was <b>Tammy McCall Browning</b>‘s nephew. “This is the first time that we’ve been on a trip and the girls have brought men home with us,” <b><a href=#>Cynthia Bailey</a></b> said. “Things could get a little wild.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kenya-moore-7d9240a5-92bb-4f3a-b7fa-0effe29f4f28.jpg><p><a href=#><b>Porsha Williams</b></a> came up with the brilliant suggestion of playing Never Have I Ever, and <a href=#><b>Kim Fields</b></a> watched in horror as she learned which women had experienced a “golden shower.” (If you don’t know what that is, maybe just leave it that way.) Porsha, who was being especially flirty with a gentleman named <b>Oliver</b>, revealed that her boyfriend,&nbsp;<b>Duke</b>, had ghosted her. “Considering that I haven’t heard from Duke in a while, I’m going to consider myself single,” she explained to the camera.</p><p>As the night wore on, there was more drinking and flesh showing — most notably Porsha’s backside, which she was parading around in a piece of flesh-colored dental floss that she was calling a bathing suit.</p><p><b>Trouble in Paradise</b></p><p>All of the women were having a blast partying it up, except for a very pregnant <a href=#><b>Kandi Burruss</b></a> and generally more reserved Kim, who bonded over their mutual disinterest in the four men.</p><p><span>For some inexplicable reason, however, <b>Glen</b> (Tammy’s nephew) went out of his way to come over and talk to Kandi and Kim — and when he didn’t like their response (which wasn’t overly friendly, but also not rude), he got a little snappy. Kandi and Kim weren’t impressed, but being sober and rational, they didn’t make much of it.</span></p><span class=caption></span><p><span>But when Glen and his friend got short with <b><a href=#>Kenya Moore</a></b>, she wasn’t content just letting it slide. “The more I hang around this guy, the more I realize his behavior is erratic,” Kenya said to the camera. “He made me uncomfortable.”</span></p><p><b>Tammy Gets Knocked Down</b></p><p>Never one to shy away from a fight, Kenya confronted Tammy about her nephew’s behavior. “He was aggressive,” Kenya told Tammy. “We’d really just like for him to leave.” Tammy, who was extremely intoxicated, responded by mumbling something that may or may not have been a complete sentence.</p><p>Meanwhile, back in the hot tub, Glen told his friend, “None of them hos can tell me any f–king thing.” In other words, he was a real Prince Charming. “It’s gonna go down,” he ominously added.</p><p><span>For her part, <b><a href=#>Sheree Whitfield</a></b> — who has had her own beef with Kenya in the past — jumped to Glen’s defense. “A few minutes ago, Kenya was flinging her dress at Glen. Now she wants to kick him out like he’s the bogeyman. Which is it?” she asked the camera.</span></p><p>When Kenya made the executive decision and asked Glen to leave, he responded by calling her a “little bitch” as he aggressively moved toward her. When Tammy stood in his path, he shoved his aunt to the floor, temporarily knocking her out. Fortunately, security rushed in to break up the fight and Tammy was taken to the hospital.</p><p><b>Pick a Side</b></p><p>Though Kenya stood by her decision to ask Glen to leave, not all of the ladies agreed with her. “This could all have been avoided if Kenya had minded her own business,” Sheree asserted. “That’s Tammy’s nephew. She could have handled it.” Though under normal circumstances Sheree might have had a point, she seemed to be forgetting that Tammy was too drunk to handle even basic tasks … like speaking.</p><p>Porsha, who had been busy the entire night flirting with a guy named Oliver, thought Kenya was “making it a little more than what it was.” Kim agreed with Porsha and thought Kenya had been reckless. “Shake a hornet’s nest and then be surprised when a whole bunch of hornets come out at you?” she shrugged to the camera. She didn’t address the fact that maybe there shouldn’t have been a man who deserved a comparison to a hornet’s nest in their villa in the first place.</p><p><span>Kenya wasn’t completely alone, however. Kandi thanked her for stepping in and Cynthia admitted she felt responsible for the situation, though it wasn’t completely clear why. For her part, Kenya wasn’t holding Cynthia or herself responsible. “You don’t provoke someone to pushing a woman,” Kenya reiterated. “Either you have it in you, or you don’t.”</span></p><p><b>Phaedra Says Kenya Acted Like a White Woman</b></p><p>The next day, <b><a href=#>Phaedra Parks</a></b> and Sheree debriefed on the events. “Everybody knows that Kenya is the queen of messy, but this time, she has really taken it to another level,” Phaedra said, prompting Sheree to argue that they “have to be careful about labeling” black men the way they thought Kenya had done.&nbsp;</p><p>Phaedra then accused Kenya of being “like any white woman in suburbia that becomes afraid.” She went on to argue that Glen “did not do anything” to deserve to be treated the way Kenya had treated him (we can only assume she meant before he knocked his aunt out cold on the floor).</p><p>Later on, the women all called Tammy to find out how she was doing. Luckily, she didn’t have a concussion, “just bruises.” They invited her to join them for dinner at their villa that night, but she didn’t end up showing.</p><p>They spent what was left of their vacation driving around in mini Hummers, having a civilized dinner party and hearing the details of Porsha’s “amazing” date with Oliver. Kim, however, missed all of this because she had fled back to Atlanta.</p><p><b>Kenya Versus Kim</b></p><p>Kenya and Kim met up for dinner, though it was pretty clear the real motive was to give each other a piece of their minds. “I just think Kim wanted to be home and she wanted to look for any excuse to leave,” Kenya said to the camera of Kim’s abrupt exit from Miami.</p><p><span>“It was a bit much, quite honestly,” Kim told Kenya, who wasn’t buying it and accused Kim of struggling to carve out her own identity apart from her family. Though Kim had basically admitted that earlier in the season, she didn’t like hearing it from Kenya so much.</span></p><p>“I’m not going to be in a situation where I feel unsafe, most especially when it crosses a line. I mean, Tammy got hurt,” she said. “I was there when Kandi and he were chatting and it didn’t seem like it had to happen that way. It seemed like you were manufacturing some drama.” Kenya, of course, denied any such intentions and insisted that wasn’t how it happened.</p><p>“He was acting in a threatening way,” she said (for the billionth time). To the camera, Kenya added, “I protected myself and I protected anyone else who was there who could have really gotten hurt if this guy had stayed and kept drinking all night.” Rather than have their own throw-down fight, however, the two ladies ultimately agreed to disagree.</p><p>Tell <i>Us</i>: Was Kenya right to ask Glen to leave?</p><p><i>The Real Housewives of Atlanta</i> airs Sundays at 8 p.m. ET on Bravo.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmhp5Fiv6avwKlkpJ2erq5uuc6oqZ5lk6S7p77Op6usZaSWuq7FjJupqK%2BenruoecycmpqknKh6r7HPoZywZZGjsW7AwKaksmWVo7G0edSpZKKmXam1pnnHqKqpoaSWuW7DkG9naXBhZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
