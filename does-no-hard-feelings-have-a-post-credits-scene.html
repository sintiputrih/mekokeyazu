As she scours the web for solutions, she happens upon a couple, Allison and Laird Becker, who offer her a used car in exchange for dating Percy, their 19-year-old, introverted, sexually-disinterested son, so as to bring him out of his shell, as it were.</p><p data-characters=274 data-current-count=274 data-injectable=false>Of course, No Hard Feelings is a movie released in 2023, so the main question on everyone’s mind is whether or not there’s a post-credits scene in play. Can’t risk sitting through the names of the people who made the movie without that extra payoff, right?</p><h2 id=h-is-there-a-post-credits-scene-in-no-hard-feelings data-injectable=false>Is there a post-credits scene in No Hard Feelings?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/no-hard-feelings.jpg><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>No, there is no post-credits scene or mid-credits scene in No Hard Feelings. It’s no surprise that this is the case, of course; no one should be going into this movie expecting it to set up any sort of shared universe, even if the thought is equal parts hilarious and uncanny.</p><p data-characters=43 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>No Hard Feelings is now playing in cinemas.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJom6ido2K7sHnHmqmdZZaasq21zaCqZqCRq7JurYyppqysXZi%2FprDIrapmq5Oau6Z7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
