But this isn't the case for everyone. For someone who identifies as demisexual, getting hot and bothered requires more — specifically, an emotional connection.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Demisexuality is a sexual orientation wherein a person is only sexually attracted to people once they feel an emotional bond," explains Casey Tanner, certified sex therapist and expert for LELO.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sure, some people might opt to wait to have sex with a partner until they feel like they've adequately gotten to know them and have established a certain level of intimacy. But for demisexual individuals, it's not a choice. "They cannot experience sexual attraction without that bond," says Tanner.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here, the basics of demisexuality and how to know if you identify with the orientation.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How "Emotional Bond" Is Defined for Demisexuals</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to establishing the type of bond required for sexual attraction, demisexual individuals might connect verbally — think discussing shared interests, hearing stories about a partner's past, or learning intimate information about a partner's dreams and desires, explains Tanner.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Or perhaps they'll grow closer through shared experiences, such as cooking meals together, playing sports together, or having shared identities. "Bonding typically involves spending quality time with the other person," says Tanner.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, that doesn't mean every emotional bond a demisexual individual forges will illicit sexual feelings, points out Tanner. "The same way that gay people aren't attracted to everyone of the same gender, demisexual folks aren't attracted to everyone they're emotionally investing in," she explains.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What Dating and Relationships Look Like for Demisexual Individuals</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"In dating, demisexuality might look like taking things slow or preferring to form a friendship before assessing further attraction," explains Tanner. "Like folks of any orientation, some demisexual individuals prefer to wait until after a commitment is made to engage sexually."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Then, when demisexual individuals form partnered relationships, their experiences vary just as much as those of queer or straight people, says Tanner.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The main difference is that attraction is more about connection as opposed to appearance, pheromones, and other forms of initial attraction, says Amy Baldwin, sex educator, sex and relationship coach, and co-host of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Shameless Sex Podcast</a>.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The Main Misconceptions About Demisexuality</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dictionary.com</a> notes that the earliest instance of 'demisexual' dates back to just 2006 when it appeared on the forums of The Asexual Visibility & Education Network (AVEN). But Tanner says that research shows demisexual individuals have always existed. "We just haven't had a word for it until recently," she explains.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nonetheless, given how new the word is, there's confusion about what the orientation actually looks like in practice. A few of the most common myths, busted:</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Demisexual individuals won't engage in casual sex.</strong> Because sexual attraction typically isn't immediate for someone who's demisexual, a common assumption about them is that they're not one to have a hookup. But identifying as demisexual doesn't negate other values that might set the stage for an impromptu romp between the sheets. "A demisexual person might still choose to have casual sex if it aligns with another one of their values, such as spontaneity, physical pleasure, or just for fun," says Tanner.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sex with a demisexual might be rare or complicated. </strong>Just because demisexual individuals take some time to warm up to the idea of sex with a new partner, they're still capable of full, exciting, and wide-ranging sexual dynamics, says Tanner.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>It'll take a while to have sex with someone who identifies as demisexual.</strong> It's not necessarily true that lengthy amounts of time must pass in order for sexual attraction to develop, says Anne Hodder-Shipp, an American College of Sexologists (ACS)-certified sex educator. "But it does mean that emotional connection and emotional safety is an important part of a demisexual's relationship process and that it deserves prioritization and attention by all partners involved."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Demisexuality is feminine vs. masculine.</strong> This stems from the gender stereotype that women and femmes require emotional or mental connection to want sex compared to the gender stereotype that men and masc folks want and are ready for sex all the time, says Hodder-Shipp.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Demisexual individuals just haven't found their match. </strong>"It's also common for folks to invalidate demisexuals as though they 'just haven't found the right person yet' or that they simply haven't found someone that they lust over at first sight," says Hodder-Shipp.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Demisexuality is the same as asexuality. </strong>There are various identities that fall on the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>spectrum of asexuality</a> (the absence or low interest in sexual attraction and activity), and demisexual is one of them. "Because demisexuals feel zero sexual attraction toward others unless they've built a strong emotional bond, demisexuality is commonly considered on this spectrum," explains Hodder-Shipp.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But others feel that because demisexuality describes experiencing sexual attraction without limitation and only under the condition of emotional connection, it isn't appropriately represented by the asexuality spectrum, she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The fact is that sex may not be rare at all for demisexual people. "Demisexuality refers to the circumstances under which one feels attracted, not the frequency," shares Tanner. "Demisexual individuals who frequently experience emotional bonds might also frequently have sex."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Baldwin sums it up: "Demisexual folks are sexual beings who seek out relationships, but connection is the primary motivator for interest as attraction as opposed to instant or primary attraction based on first-time impressions."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Demisexuality is the same as graysexuality. </strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Graysexuality</a>, which also appears on the asexuality spectrum, is marked by limited sexual attraction or sexual attraction that occurs only under certain conditions or contexts. Some graysexual people might only feel it once or twice in their life. Hodder-Shipp warns against people confusing or conflating demisexuality with graysexuality. "They're not the same sexual orientation by any means," she says.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How to Know If You're Demisexual</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wondering if you're demisexual? Consider the following steps.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Reflect on previous experiences in which you experienced sexual attraction.</strong> Ask yourself questions like:</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><li>Was that attraction there immediately, or did it build once you felt an emotional connection?</li><li>Can you think of a time when you felt sexual desire for someone with whom you did not share a bond?</li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And perhaps you've never seen someone from across the room or met someone at a party and immediately wanted to get it on in the coatroom, adds Hodder-Shipp.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Think back on times when your non-demisexual friends were expressing attraction. </strong>For example, perhaps they were describing sexual desire for an actor in a movie or feeling certain about whether or not they desired physical touch after a first date. If you couldn't relate, you might be demisexual.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>You find the "honeymoon" phase of a relationship to be less about lots of sex and spontaneous arousal. </strong>Instead, it's more about non-sexual connection and bonding activities, says Hodder-Shipp. This phase might also involve uncertainty or unsettledness.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Ultimately, if the label 'demisexual' feels validating and helps you communicate your style of attraction, you have the right to embrace this label regardless of whether or not you're 100% sure it applies," notes Tanner. "While sexual orientation is not a choice, language is imperfect, and sometimes it helps to try on a specific label to see if it feels right for you."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're looking for more information on demisexuality, Tanner notes that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>the Demisexuality Resource Center</a> is a good place to start.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme9ahmK1lmah6pbHMoqqesKWWuQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
