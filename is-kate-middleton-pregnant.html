The Palace has confirmed that Middleton underwent abdominal surgery in January, but nonetheless conspiracy theories have only grown and grown online, ranging from the absurd ‚Äî that she‚Äôs preparing to join Celebrity Big Brother ‚Äî to the sinister ‚Äî that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she‚Äôs secretly died</a>. One that‚Äôs somewhere in the middle? The rumor that Princess Catherine is pregnant.</p><h2 id=h-could-kate-middleton-be-pregnant data-injectable=false>Could Kate Middleton be pregnant?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-1800484507.jpg><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=747 data-injectable=true>As the conspiracy theories about Kate‚Äôs disappearance go, the rumor that she‚Äôs pregnant is not one of the most outlandish. As anyone who has the Royal Family tree memorized will tell you, Kate already has three children with Prince William ‚Äî Prince George (born 2013), Prince Charlotte (2015), and Prince Louis (2018). Queen Elizabeth II also had four children, so the couple rounding their brood up to that number is not impossible.</p><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true>Nevertheless, many have noted that Kate has previously been very active both during and immediately after her prior pregnancies, which pours cold water on this theory. As <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one viral tweet reads</a>, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre telling me that Kate Middleton ‚Äî the same woman who posed outside the hospital like a freaking supermodel mere hours after giving birth ‚Äî suddenly requires months of recovery before showing her face?‚Äù</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>You‚Äôre telling me that Kate Middleton‚Äîthe same woman who posed outside the hospital like a freaking supermodel mere hours after giving birth‚Äîsuddenly requires months of recovery before showing her face?

Like every conspiracy theory from us commoners, though, there is not a shred of evidence to suggest that Middleton really is pregnant. As those who have undergone abdominal surgery themselves <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">have attested</a>, sometimes you do simply need several weeks to recover.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ever have abdominal surgery? I have and it's a bitch. When they cut the muscles in your stomach it's kind of hard to use them for balance, getting up and down and out of chairs or your bed, and picking things up.
