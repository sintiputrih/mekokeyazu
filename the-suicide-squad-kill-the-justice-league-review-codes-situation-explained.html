Beyond that, the game features <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the final performance of Kevin Conroy as Batman</a>, leaving it as a swan song for the most beloved actor to voice the Dark Knight.</p><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=802 data-injectable=true>But it’s safe to say that the mood amongst gaming fans is subdued. The game is an online-only multiplayer-focused title with season passes, cosmetics, and much DLC on the horizon. Though design like this may have been in style early in development, a litany of failed games-as-a-service titles have soured gamers on them, and we need only miserably gesture to the decomposing corpses of Marvel’s Avengers, Anthem, and Redfall as proof.</p><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>On top of that, what’s been showcased of the gameplay <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hasn’t set the world alight.</a> As opposed to the incredible close-quarters combat of the Arkham games, this is a third-person shooter, with many noting that the game appears to boil down to shooting glowing purple orbs.</p><p data-characters=108 data-current-count=391 data-injectable=false>As such, many are probably waiting for the reviews to decide whether to buy. There’s just one problem.</p><h2 id=h-what-s-the-review-codes-situation data-injectable=false>What’s the review codes situation?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=691 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=534 data-current-count=534 data-injectable=true>As of this writing, five days before public early access begins, indications are that Warner Bros. Games has yet to make the game available to any members of the gaming press. We Got This Covered hasn’t received a code. I’ve checked with my contacts elsewhere in the gaming press and they haven’t received a code. In yesterday’s Giant Bomb’s ‘Game Mess Mornings’ podcast <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">host Jeff Grubb said</a>: “It’s out in a week and I don’t know anyone that has a review code for it.”</p><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=224 data-injectable=false>Co-host Lucy James said she hadn’t heard of anyone who has a review copy, either. It’s possible that other outlets already have copies and are keeping quiet about it, but everything I’ve seen indicates not.</p><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=526 data-injectable=true>So what does this mean? Well, if reviewers don’t have a copy, the period in which to evaluate the game in rapidly diminishes. Suicide Squad is sounding like a 20 hour+ game, and getting to grips with the multiple characters and systems within it will take time that reviewers now might not have.</p><p data-characters=668 data-current-count=668 data-injectable=true>As a vague rule of thumb, reviewers can usually expect to receive a code roughly two weeks before the official launch, giving us enough time to appreciate and complete a title without having to rush through it to meet the deadline of the embargo dropping. One could argue that Rocksteady Studios needs time to make last-minute tweaks before sending the review codes out, though the game has already been delayed a year, so we’d expect it to be polished by now. Similarly, perhaps the online framework needs to be in place before launch, though this didn’t stop similarly online-focused games like Exoprimal from sending their review codes out in good time.</p><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=301 data-injectable=false>What this means is that reviewers won’t have time to properly play Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League before its release next week. Reviews that land on the embargo will be rushed, and we suspect many outlets will be forced to delay publishing their opinions until after the launch weekend.</p><p data-characters=196 data-current-count=497 data-injectable=false>Read between the lines on why that might be beneficial to sales if you choose, but right now it seems Warner Bros. Games is playing its cards incredibly close to the vest with this specific title.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZoq6GdXajCqq%2FInZxmq6GqrqV5yqKjpWWknbJuttSsq6KblWK5pq3GrpxmqpWrtqbDjJymnZ2jYsCqwNSaq6KnnmKyubzLmqCnnZRk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
