They have been loaned to us temporarily for the purpose of loving them and instilling a foundation of values on which their future lives will be built.</li><li>One of the most important responsibilities in the Christian life is to care about others, smile at them, and be a friend to the friendless.</li><li>When I was about ten, I was very impressed by the way Tarzan could swing through the trees from vine to vine. No one ever told me, ‘Don’t try this at home.’</li><li>I don’t blame homosexuals for being angry when people say they’ve made a choice to be gay because they don’t.</li><li>If traditional marriage is not the law of the land, the institution of the family will cease to exist.</li><li>I don’t want to make a mistake that would hurt the cause of Christ late in my life, so I’m going to do everything I can to bring many people to Christ.
