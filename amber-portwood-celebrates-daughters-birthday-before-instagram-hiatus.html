You can still contact me though. I will get certain messages. #sendinglove.”</p><p>On Tuesday, November 12, the reality star shared another sweet shot with Leah, writing, “What an absolute beautiful day with family and this beautiful Birthday girl!! Hope everyone had a great day like I had!!&nbsp;<span class="markxq92pyn43 SSBqA0O5vTLfa9GC1wxGQ" data-markjs=true>Happy Birthday</span>&nbsp;baby.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Amber-Portwood-Celebrates-Daughter-Leahs-11th-Birthday-Instagram.jpg><p>The MTV personality went on to pen <a href=#>an emotional tribute to the preteen</a> as well. “I love our hugs,” the Indiana native captioned a picture of Leah eating dinner on a boat. “I love our kisses and I love singing together while looking into each other’s eyes. I love how you make me feel every time I see you. I love the text messages we send of funny gifs and when you say Goodnight but keep texting emojis. But what I love most of all is when you tell me I love you Mommy and I say I love you too beautiful. You are everything and more.”</p><p>The 16 and Pregnant alum, who also shares <a href=#>her 18-month-old son, James</a>, with her ex <strong>Andrew Glennon</strong>, welcomed her eldest in 2008 with <a href=#><strong>Gary Shirley</strong></a>.</p><p>When it comes to coparenting, <a href=#>the former couple are “doing really good,”</a> Portwood told Us Weekly exclusively in June.&nbsp;“I don’t want to sound like I’m lying, but hell, everything is so positive right now,” she said at the time. “It took years. It took a long time. It took growth on both parties. We really kind of met in the middle and became a whole family now.”</p><p>The following month, the Never Too Late author was <a href=#>arrested for assaulting Glennon, 35, while he was holding their son</a> and was charged with two counts of domestic battery and one of criminal recklessness with a deadly weapon.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I wish we could just wake up and say it was a dream,” Gary’s wife, <strong>Kristina Shirley</strong>, said on an August episode of Teen Mom OG. “Ultimately, Leah is almost 11. <a href=#>She knows a lot of what’s going on</a>. I think the only thing she’s said to me is, ‘If Mommy goes back to prison, what happens to James? Will James be taken away from me as well?’ I don’t have those answers.”</p><p>Gary, 33, added, “This has an impact on all of us. She didn’t just affect her own self and her own family. It trickles down to us too.”</p><p><a href=#>Portwood received a plea deal following her arrest</a>, a source told Us exclusively in October. She will receive one felony charge for the incident and be on probation for one year, and the felony charge will be lowered to a misdemeanor provided no problems arise, the insider revealed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaapZKav268zqursKefmXqkscuemauZpJrAbrDArp6hrJWnwG6uyKuroZyRrnqjscWoqZ5lmaPAta3Gq5imZZierrXB0mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
