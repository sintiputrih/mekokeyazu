Someone needed to represent Boggs' district in Louisiana, as he had also been posthumously reelected, and who better to do that then his widow, Lindy Boggs, who held the seat from the time of her husband's disappearance in 1972 until 1991. Their daughter, Cokie Roberts, was 28 years old at the time of her father's disappearance and was a mother of two working at a news station in California, per <a href=#>The Washington Post</a>. She went on to become an Emmy-winning journalist and political commentator.</p><p dir=ltr>The deaths of Boggs, Begich, Brown, and Jonz led directly to Congress taking a step toward making planes easier to recover in the event that something like this were to ever happen again. According to <a href=#>Politico</a>, the mandate stipulates that all civilian aircraft must be fitted with an emergency locator transmitter.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCFj3Jwa29fna6tsYybpqCfo2LBqbGMrqpmm5%2BjtLOx0qykmqZdrLWwecOiqpqooJqus7HDZqCnrJ9iwam1zWaYoqpf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
