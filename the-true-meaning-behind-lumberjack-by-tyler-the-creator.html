"Used to laugh at me, listen to me with their ears closed," he says in the second verse. "Used to treat me like <a href=#>that boy from 'Malcolm in the Middle'</a> / Now I'm zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero." In the first verse, Tyler even brags about how much he paid Drake for performing at his festival, Camp Flog Gnaw, in 2019. "I hit Drizzy and told him I had a milli' for him," Tyler raps. Considering that he only performed for about 30 mins, that's a pretty hefty fee.</p><p dir=ltr>However, there is one line, in particular, that seems to resonate with fans. In the chorus, Tyler gives his parents a shot-out for conceiving him. "Rolls-Royce pull up, Black boy hop out / Shoutout to my mother and my father, didn't pull out." "Tyler the creator said in Lumberjack 'shout out to my father didn't pull out' I felt that LMFAOOOO," one fan wrote on <a href=#>Twitter</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>And though the aforementioned line seems to be a favorite among fans, Tyler loves all of his lyrics equally. "EVERY LINE," Tyler <a href=#>tweeted</a>, replying to a fan asking which line from "CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST" was his favorite. "I DIDNT EXAGGERATE ANYTHING. EVERYTHING ON HERE IS REAL AND REALLY MY LIFE, HONESTLY MY MOST PERSONAL ALBUM SO ITS ILL THAT PEOPLE ARE INTO IT."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbW1kboVye9OhnGasoqqybrnEmqWippdir6a0yKebZqSloq%2BmvsmamqRlkq56tcXLnqlmrJiaeqS%2BxJqrqKpf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
