Comments like "@PetSmart how could you," and "@PetSmart is CANCELED" piled up.</p><p>One user also noted that they would no longer be shopping there.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: tiktok</span></figure><p>However, a handful of folks seemed to already be aware of PetSmart's practices.</p><p>"PetSmart has been doing this for years. I found an entire colony of hermit crabs back in 2016," wrote one user. Another chimed in that they saved a group of kittens that the store was trying to toss.</p><p>One former employee even explained that this merciless practice of discarding animals was the reason why they quit.</p><p>A spokesperson for PetSmart reached out to Distractify with the following statement: "We are pet parents and nothing is more important than the health and safety of pets in our care. This was an isolated incident, made in error, which we sincerely regret. We are using this situation to review store policies and procedures with our team to reinforce our industry-leading pet care standards."</p><p>But as one person pointed out, it's not just PetSmart that's discarding live animals. It's other pet retailers, too. "This reminds me of the video of somebody's father finding a hamster in the Petco trash dumpster," said one userwrote.</p><p>In fact, several videos have been posted across the platform showing the live-animal filled dumpsters behind different PetSmart and Petco locations.</p><p>Besides fish, live birds, hamsters, and reptiles have been found in the dumpsters of both stores.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@pitbullsoverpeople href=#>@pitbullsoverpeople</a><p>@petsmart explain yourselves….. thanks to @jessicakollar3 for posting the original video….
