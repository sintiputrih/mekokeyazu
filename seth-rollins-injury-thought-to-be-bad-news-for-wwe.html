Sadly, Rollins was also injured in the process, which is not how he wanted to end his night at all.</p><p><a href=#>It is unknown how bad Seth Rollins</a> was injured on RAW this week, but no news may not be great news in this instance. Now, we have a bit of an update about how people are thinking.</p><p>Wade Keller first broke the story that Seth Rollins is injured. He went on to say on the<a href=#> PW Torch </a>podcast that the current mindset is not good about Rollins, but it’s unknown how bad it is.</p><p>“Connecting some dots, I am thinking it’s not good news but I don’t know&nbsp;how bad&nbsp;the news is. The reason for that is, I’ve asked a bunch of people and some of whom would likely be privy to what’s going on who won’t comment. I understand there’s internal policies on that. But I would think if he was fine and he ‘walked it off’ [then] we’d be hearing that. Now it’s possible they’re gonna do a story on television because the news of Seth’s injury has&nbsp;gone crazy. I don’t know how many dozens of websites quoted my breaking news story on Monday night but obviously people who are on social media and Reddit know about the fact that he was legitimately hurt and limping backstage and everyone quoted my reports on that. They could be doing a storyline where they’re gonna play into that on TV and go from a situation where Seth’s knee is not that bad and play it up as if it is as some sort of storyline. So I’m throwing that out there as a caveat to the hunch that I’m getting from colleagues of his and other people in WWE. They either think it’s bad news and WWE’s gonna probably have Seth announce something on TV…or they’re just waiting for more test results to get something more definitive. But they want to control the narrative on&nbsp;him&nbsp;at this point because people who know aren’t commenting.”</p><p>“I just think people who do know would go ‘Oh he’s fine, it’s no big deal, blown out of proportion’ if that was the case. This is my long winded way of saying I don’t know but I’m passing along transparently [from] one of the wrestlers who was around&nbsp;him&nbsp;Monday night after Raw [and] just said, ‘I don’t think it’s good. My gut says injury. Maybe he’ll work through it, he’s tough.’ Another colleague of his said that he thought Seth, because of his&nbsp;history&nbsp;of injuries, would have had a good idea if he should finish a match with the injury and if he should be walking on it backstage. Because he finished the match and because he was able to walk on it, that it might be one of those situations where he just needs to rest it for a few weeks. But even that wrestler wasn’t ruling out that it could be worse.”</p><p>We’re hoping for the best when it comes to Seth Rollins’ injury status. This is the last thing WWE needed, because they don’t want to lose someone like Rollins on the road to WrestleMania. After all, this could affect plans for more than just him at the show of shows.</p><p>Keep checking back with us here at <a href=#>Ringside News</a> for more on this story and so many more.
