These cherished times with his mum, Wendy laid the foundation for Ian’s positive and joyful childhood.

It wasn’t just an ordinary day; it was a testament to the enduring love between Ed, Ian and Donavan.</p><p>On a sun-kissed day, amidst the gentle ripples of water, Edward Maatsen and his sons, Ian and Donavan, indulged in a memorable water vacation. Floating effortlessly on a water trampoline, Ed and Donavan basked in the sheer joy of the moment.</p><p>The brothers (Ian and Donavan) lay side by side, soaking up the serenity of the moment, feeling the cool embrace of the water and the warmth of the sun. These are two brothers (best friends) raised in a nurturing military home that emphasized the values of discipline, togetherness and love.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=ian-maatsen-early-life></span>Ian Maatsen Early Life:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><span>A Difficult Career Start:</span> Ian’s path to realizing his dreams was riddled with challenges.

By the age of 7, with the support of his parents, Ian was enrolled at Feyenoord, the childhood dream club.</p><p>It took no time because challenges began to plague young Ian. He faced growth issues during his childhood, which posed significant barriers to his early career progression. The truth is, Ian’s stature led to unforeseen repercussions. Despite joining Feyenoord’s esteemed academy, the poor boy faced the harsh reality of being deemed “too small” for the sport, resulting in his removal from the team. This painful setback would lead him on a new trajectory, whose details we will unfold in subsequent sections.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ian-maatsen-family-background></span>Ian Maatsen Family Background:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Athlete’s parents, Edward Maatsen and Wendy Schuitemaker, have been married since the 19th of January 1989. Sometime in 2022, around the 25th of June, Ian and his brother, <span>Donavan, witnessed what looks like the renewal of their parents’ marital vow.</span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=getting-to-know-ian-maatsens-parents></span>Getting to know Ian Maatsen’s Parents:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Starting with his Dad, Edward, is a former military officer. He was a member of the Dutch Marines. Edward also worked with the Ministry of Defence. Further jobs that saw him work at the Haaglanden Fire Department. While there, Ian’s Dad rose to become the Chief Fire Officer at Haaglanden Safety Region.</p><p>Regarding his education, Edward Maatsen graduated from Rehoboth Mavo High School – class of 1985. He is also a graduate of Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, class of 1988 (MLO Chemistry). A year after his son, Ian was born, he started a job at Dansschool Sitton / Commedia (April 2003).</p><p>Ian Maatsen’s Dad, Edward, is a huge lover of skateboarding.

Edwards has been doing Telemark skiing and snowboarding with his colleagues for around 14 years.</p><p>Sometime around March of 2013, Edward Maatsen enjoyed his skiing, telemarking and snowboarding with his family by his side. Here is a video of Ed at the snow field of Pruggern, Austria, with fellow sportspersons and his family. How nice of Donovan, his first son and Ian’s older brother, to be the Cameraman.</p><p>Regarding the occupation of Ian Maatsen’s Mother, results from our research reveal that Wendy is an Internal Account Manager. Wendy Schuitemaker’s LinkedIn, she worked as an&nbsp; Internal Account Manager (IAM) with Dun and Bradstreet, The Randstad, Netherlands. This is an American company that provides commercial data, analytics, and insights for businesses.</p><p>Considering what he has been through in life, Ian sees a large part of his success coming from his Dad’s impact. As a former military man, Edward Maatsen made discipline to be a centrepiece in his home. He often tells Ian what to do and what not to do in the face of difficulties.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=a-close-knit-household></span>A Close-knit Household:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Although Ian’s early career was dotted with dreams and disappointments, he was always accompanied by a contestant and unweavered support. Here, we talk about Ian Maatsen’s Family members (both nuclear and extended). Persons who had become his pillar, holding him up during the toughest career moments.</p><p>This close-knit bond that has existed in Ian Maatsen’s Family, which was forged in adversity, is evident even today. Now that their breadwinner basks in the spotlight, these persons still stand right alongside him, sharing in the joy of his career successes.</p><p>On this day (as observed in the photo below), their pride was palpable when they stood with him at Turf Moor. Right there at Burnley’s stadium, the Maatsen clan rejoiced with one of their own who had just helped Burnley win the EFL Championship. On this day, it wasn’t just Ian’s win but a collective triumph for the Maatsen family.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ian-maatsen-family-origin></span>Ian Maatsen Family Origin:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The fact that his parents had him at Vlaardingen (South Holland) automatically grants him both a Dutch passport and the country’s citizenship. However, there is more to Ian Maatsen’s origins. Research has it that the Dutch Leftback and Winger is of Surinamese descent. Now, where is Surinamese does the footballer come from?</p><p>Ian Maatsen’s family hails from Paramaribo, in Suriname. Paramaribo, situated on the banks of the Suriname River, is the capital city of Suriname. The country of Ian Maatsen’s ancestry, Suriname, speaks Dutch, and it is the smallest nation in South America, both in terms of land area and population.</p><p>As depicted on the map to the right, Suriname— the homeland of the Maatsen family— shares its borders with French Guiana to the east, Brazil to the south, Guyana to the west and the Atlantic Ocean to the north.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-ian-maatsens-ethnicity></span>What is Ian Maatsen’s Ethnicity?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The footballer identifies with an ethnic group known as “Dutch Surinamese.” This ethnic term describes a person of Surinamese descent who was born in, or has ties to, the Netherlands. It is pertinent to state that Suriname and the Netherlands share a history together. Suriname was a Dutch colony until it achieved independence in 1975.</p><p>There are a few footballers (present or retired) who are Dutch Surinamese that you probably don’t know about. Active footballers here include <span>Denzel Dumfries</span>, <span>Ki-Jana Hoever,</span> <span>Tyrell Malacia, Xavi Simons</span> and <span>Crysencio Summerville</span>. The list of retired footballers includes Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, Edgar Davids, and the legendary Clarence Seedorf.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ian-maatsens-education></span>Ian Maatsen’s Education:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Early on, Edward and Wendy ensured schooling for their children. Ian Maatesn’s older brother, Donavan Dorrell Maatsen, is a Mechanical engineering service technician by profession. He studied Mech Engineering at Albeda RDM Campus, an Educational institution in Rotterdam, Netherlands.</p><p>Although the exact school is not yet known, it is believed that Ian attended structured schooling in his birth country (The Netherlands). Before leaving his childhood club (Feyenoord) at the age of 11, Maatsen’s primary education (also known as Basisonderwijs) had come to a conclusive stage. Before devoting himself to a full career and leaving the Netherlands for England, he completed his Secondary schooling.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ian-maatsens-biography-%e2%80%93-football-story></span>Ian Maatsen’s Biography – Football Story:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>A passionate Feyenoord fan, he realized his dream of joining the club in 2009. For Ian Maatsen, football initially was more about enjoyment at his new club. His age group engaged in activities rarely seen among professional footballers – forming a bond with their rivals, Ajax, before a championship match. In response to this, a Facebook friend of Ian’s father, Edward Maatsen, commented:</p><p>Edward, look, that’s how it should be.</p><p>As a true Feyenoord supporter, I can enjoy it.</p><p>And even if they (Feyenoord and ajax) are the two biggest rivals.</p><p>As the season unfolded, players faced increasing expectations, both regarding their performance and their physical development. Regrettably, Ian didn’t experience the anticipated physical growth. Examining the photo below, it’s evident he is one of the smallest, if not the smallest, in his age group. Given that no further physical growth was expected after a certain point, the club had to make a decision.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=when-the-going-got-tough></span>When the going got tough:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Ian Maatsen faced the same challenge encountered by Athletes like <span>Jaidon Anthony</span>, the Legendary <span>Roy Keane</span>, <span>Jacob Ramsey</span> and <span>Aaron Ramsdale</span>. Poor Ian was judged as being too small, and that caused a huge setback in his young career.</p><p>In the case of <span>Raphinha</span>, Luis Diaz and <span>Lucas Paqueta</span>, the Europa Conference League winner with West Ham, they were labelled as too skinny to play football. For Paquesta, it almost ruined their career If not for the bold intervention of his Mum, Marcelo de Lima.</p><p><span>Even the likes of Karim Adeyemi</span> were released by Bayern Munich because of a dispute and a lack of social interaction (on his part).</p><p>Ian Maatsen suffered the fate of Ramsdale, who (in his own case) was released by Bolton Wanderers for being too small. Maatsen, the Dutch football, was dropped by his childhood club (Feyenoord) for allegedly being too small. This unfortunate event happened when he was 11.</p><p>Reacting to the unfortunate event, Ian Maatsen once narrated the pains he felt with the club’s decision to kick him out. In his words;</p><p>“After Feyenoord released me at the age of 11, I thought football was over for me. I didn’t care anymore, I just wanted to be with my friends.</p><p>I was small and they said I didn’t have the potential to play boy’s football and make it professionally.</p><p>Sadly, I thought differently. obviously, but I took it in my chest with the mindset to prove them wrong.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ian-maatsens-bio-%e2%80%93-the-journey-to-finding-fame></span>Ian Maatsen’s Bio – The Journey to Finding Fame:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After being released, he never used his mouth to say he would prove them wrong. Rather, Ian Maatsen used his mind. He stayed humble, kept his head down and made up his mind to work harder. For a boy who was just entering his teenage years, it was indeed a hard pill to swallow.</p><p>Truth be told, any aspiring young teenage footballer who has lived through an academy rejection (especially those in Africa) knows a lot about the emotional pains that come with it. As expected, Ian Maatsen’s parents consoled and reassured him during that difficult phase of his life.</p><p>After Feyenoord released him, he (who was so undeterred) moved on to Sparta Rotterdam. Ian had a career boost at the club, spending a further two seasons there before making a huge youth career move to PSV. He joined a top Dutch club that saw the development of some great players. We talk about names like Ruud van Nistelrooy, <span>Arjen Robben</span>, <span>Memphis Depay</span>, <span>Steven Bergwijn</span>, <span>Cody&nbsp;Gakpo</span>, etc.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ian-maatsens-biography-%e2%80%93-rise-to-fame></span>Ian Maatsen’s Biography – Rise to Fame:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On the 1st of July, 2018, fourteen days before the FIFA World Cup, Ian made a decision to switch from PSV Youth to Chelsea U18. Not many football fans know that Chelsea signed the Left-Back for the little sum of €110k.</p><p>Ian joined Chelsea five years after he was chased out of Feyenoord. It was reported that not all family members agreed with his decision to leave his country for England at a very young age. Chiefly among these persons is Ian Maatsen’s Mother.</p><p>While her husband, Edward, was in support of it, Wendy did not want her last son to leave PSV. However, it was advice from Ian Maatsen’s father that saw him take that giant leap. Let’s not forget that Edward is a tough Dad, a former military officer who loves the challenges in life.</p><p>Barely a year after being in the Chelsea academy roaster, Maatsen got a call to represent the Netherlands for the U17 Euros (in 2019). That tournament boasts rising stars like <span>Brian Brobbey</span>, <span>Anthony Elanga</span>, <span>Ki-Jana Hoever</span>, <span>Karim Adeyemi</span>, <span>Yeremy Pino</span>, etc.</p><p>A versatile Maatsen took on the role of a defensive midfielder during the U-17 tournament, aiding the Netherlands in securing the 2019 UEFA European Under-17 Championship. As highlighted, Ian Maatsen’s mother, Wendy, along with her husband, Ed and eldest son, Donovan, were all in attendance to mark the special occasion.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=not-part-of-frank-lampards-plans></span>Not part of Frank Lampard’s plans:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>After the triumph in the U-17 championship, Ian’s advancement within the Chelsea youth ranks was rapid. Demonstrating his progress, the emerging Dutch talent got promoted to the club’s under-23 team within a year. At that time, it seemed inevitable that Frank Lampard would soon beckon him to the senior squad.</p><p>Ian struggled to secure a spot in Frank Lampard’s Chelsea squad. He was in the same boat as Billy Gilmour and Tariq Lamptey, who also felt they weren’t primary considerations in the coach’s strategy. Particularly for Ian, the left-back position was hotly contested by established names like <span>Ben&nbsp;Chilwell</span>, <span>Marcos Alonso</span>, and <span>Emerson Palmieri</span> being the top three preferences.</p><p>Instead of settling as the fourth option, Ian charted his own path. Unlike Kurt <span>Kurt Zouma</span>, <span>Jamal Musiala</span> and <span>Marc Guehi</span>, who permanently transferred away from the club, the young talent opted for a loan stint with Coventry. During his time there, Maatsen made Chelsea proud, earning the distinction of the 2021–2022 Young Talent of the Season award.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-burnley-success></span>The Burnley success:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In the 2022/2023 season, Ian returned from his Chelsea loan and agreed to join Burnley on loan (for a fee of €5.00m). He, who did well at the club, was part of Vincent Kompany’s team that eventually won the EFL league and got promotion to the Premier League. At Burnley, Ian enjoyed a fine 2023/2024 season with notables like <span>Ashley Barnes</span>, <span>Manuel Benson</span>, <span>Michael Obafemi</span>, etc.</p><p>As a reward for his hard work, Maatsen was included in the 2022/2023 Championship Team of the Season as the best left-back in the league. During the victory lap, Ian proudly waved the Surinamese flag, honouring his roots. As previously mentioned in this biography, his ancestry traces back to Paramaribo, in Suriname.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-ian-maatsens-girlfriend></span>Who is Ian Maatsen’s Girlfriend?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Assisting Burnley in clinching the 2022/2023 EFL Championship is undeniably a significant career milestone. It’s an indication that the man whom <span>Guardiola is monitoring</span> is on the path to a stellar career. There’s a popular adage that behind every successful footballer comes a glamorous partner. This prompts Wiki to pose the following question:</p><p>Who is Ian Maatsen dating?</p><p>From the beginning, Maatsen projected a persona that prioritized his professional commitments, often keeping his personal life out of the public eye. However, in 2023, when his Burnley team celebrated their EFL Championship victory, he made an exception.</p><p>On this occasion, Ian introduced his girlfriend to his followers on Instagram. While her name remains undisclosed as of this biography’s last update, she evidently stands firmly behind her boyfriend’s ambitions.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=personal-life></span>Personal Life:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Who is Ian Maatsen?</p><p>First, let’s tell you what the Dutch professional footballer is all about.

A fervent fan of coastal getaways, Ian believes no seaside retreat is complete without his girlfriend accompanying him. A splendid way indeed to unwind after the whirlwind of the 2022/2023 season.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=ian-maatsens-car></span>Ian Maatsen’s Car:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The footballer’s choice of vehicle, the G-Wagon, aligns with a trend prevalent among other top footballers. Examples of them are <span>Wilfried Zaha</span>, <span>Kalvin Phillips</span>, <span>Renato Sanches, Christopher Nkunku</span>, etc.</p><p>For Ian, the colour choice of ash for his G-Wagon accentuates the vehicle’s elegance. His ash colour signifies a preference for understated luxury.&nbsp;In essence, this G-Wagon, especially in ash, complements Ian’s status as a football star who likes to enjoy his wealth.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ian-maatsen-family-facts></span>Ian Maatsen Family Facts:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>You must have encountered in this Bio how members of his household have been instrumental in laying the groundwork for Ian’s success in both his career and personal life.

He is a former military man and a Chief Fire Officer. The Dutch professional footballer was born in March 2002 to his mother, Wendy Schuitemaker, an Internal Account Manager.</p><p>Early on, every member of Ian Maatsen’s family was proud because he and his cousin Dalian were at Feyenoord. Sadly, the Dutch club released Ian from their academy simply because he was too short.</p><p>At that age, it was very difficult for young Ian Maatesn to take. It was painful seeing other boys get through when he got dropped from Feyenoord, a club he played for six years. That made little Ian begin to think that maybe football wasn’t for him.</p><p>Ian Maatsen’s family came to his rescue. They advised him never to give up, on his God-given talent. The truth is, it was disappointing, especially for the whole family, to see Ian leave Feyenoord at the age of seven or eight. In fact, the boy from the Dutch town of Vlaardingen was forced to grow up from a very young age.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=life-after-academy-rejection></span>Life after academy rejection:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Things began going very quickly for Ian after his Feyenoord exit. Moving on, the youngster went to Sparta and then to another of the traditional ‘Dutch big three’ in PSV Eindhoven. It was a long three-hour round trip from the Maatsen family home.</p><p>Soon, Chelsea came to sign Ian as a teenager. In the Netherlands, you often hear people complain when young footballers go abroad at a young age. Some of these people would say these footballers are destined to fail.</p><p>The truth is, Ian Maatsen proved a lot of people wrong. It was Ian’s mentality to overcome setbacks that played a major role in the path to success as a professional footballer.</p><p>Ian was proud to see himself in a club that has top stars like Eden Hazard, Willian, and Marcos Alonso, guys he normally sees on FIFA. As a pro, his successful loan spell under Clarets boss Vincent Kompany led to his gigantic rise.</p><p>Following his return to Stamford Bridge, Ian has shown that he can put up a challenge to both Chilwell and Marc Cucurella. In fact, his family are happy for him, especially for the fact that he represents their surname at a very high level.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=appreciation-note></span>Appreciation Note:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Thank you for taking out time to read Wiki’s version of Ian Maatsen’s Biography.
