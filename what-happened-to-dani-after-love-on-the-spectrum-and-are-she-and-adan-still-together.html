The DaniMation team and I are excited to see an increase in student sign-ups for our one-on-one animation sessions. Recently, I had the privilege of keynoting at two autism conferences in Hershey, Pennsylvania, and Orlando, Florida. During these events, I shared my personal journey as an autistic individual and the inception of DaniMation. On a personal note, I just celebrated my 29th birthday on January 9!

On a positive note, my best friend Devin has suggested the idea of meeting somewhere in the middle for our next date. It sounds like a great plan to bridge the distance and make our time together more manageable.”</p><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=243 data-injectable=false>Our fingers are crossed that Dani and Adan can make their medium distance relationship work, but nonetheless, fans of the franchise can stream all episodes of Love on the Spectrum US season 2 now via Netflix to watch Dani Bowman look for love.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsGnuMixZrCgkal6qa3PqZynnZRiwbB5w5qlomWRm8Gmvoylpq%2BdXaS7bsDHnmSsqJWYwbPBzGaYp5xdlr%2BmedKhnGaZnpl6orDAp2SsrJmhuW7AzqCcraCVp3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
