With Ja now publicly accepting bookings for private parties and the video from one such gig going viral, 50 is having fun at his foe’s expense.
That begs questions about how much money Ja Rule has in his bank account and why he is finding it necessary to engage in all the new extra work."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Others include Fat Joe, DMX, Trina, and Ja’s collaborative partner Ashanti.</p><h2>50 Cent roasts Ja over recent work</h2><p>There’s been a longstanding feud involving Ja Rule and <a href=#>rapper 50 Cent</a> which originated in the late ’90s and is still going on to this day.</p><p>So 50 Cent made sure to go at Ja over the recent revelation that he’s decided to take on private bookings.</p><p>50 took to his Twitter to retweet a video of him looking amused in a photo side-by-side with Ja’s private party gig.</p><p>“If you don’t want to end up doing private birthday parties for 15 people stay out of my way, OK,” 50 captioned it with.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>if you don’t want to end up doing private birthday parties for 15 people. ??‍♂️stay out of my way, OK. <a href=#>#bransoncognac</a> <a href=#>#lecheminduroi</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/HkXblUKNMg</a></p><p>— 50cent (@50cent) <a href=#>June 21, 2020</a></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Ja rose to fame back in the ’90s as part of the Cash Money Click. He’d go on to release a number of studio albums, including Venni Vetti Vecci, in 1999, which went to No. 1 on the Billboard 200.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>He also had several hits, including Holla Holla, Wonderful, and the aforementioned I’m Real with JLo. In addition to working with JLo, he worked alongside R. Kelly, Ashanti, and even Jay Z.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>He’s also appeared in movies over the year like Scary Movie 3, The Cookout, and The Fast and the Furious.</span></p><h2>Ja Rule’s net worth in question</h2><p>As Ja Rule seems to be needing this extra work, it has people wondering if he’s short on money. Estimates from various websites put Ja Rule’s net worth between $2-8 million, but his recent side jobs suggest otherwise.</p><p>It’s also possible he just loves performing and getting up close and personal with fans.</p><p>However, he’s had money problems over the years. There’s the Fyre Festival in the Bahamas, which was a major fiasco in Ja’s career, leading to a $100 million class-action lawsuit against Ja and the event’s co-founder.</p><p>However, a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC report</a> from 2019 stated that Ja’s lawyers argued his name was used to promote the event by its organizers.</p><p>Ja’s also had other money problems, including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tax evasion charges</a>, which led to a prison stint for the rapper. He may be trying to get back on his feet, despite all the success he’s enjoyed.</p><p>At the very least, he’s seeming to keep trying to earn to keep himself afloat and relevant. After all, his foe 50 famously called his classic debut album, Get Rich or Die Tryin’, so Ja may be following that advice.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6cnKWdkqe2tcWOo5hmqqWhsrR5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8GpecinZKyon6m5qrPHrWSaq12dsm6twpycqayjYq%2Bwu8qipaCrXaS7brXCqKWnZZ2afA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
