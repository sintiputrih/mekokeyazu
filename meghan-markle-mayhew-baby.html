Duchess Meghan was in the British capital’s Kensal Rise neighborhood for her first official visit to the Mayhew—an animal welfare center for which she is officially royal patron.
Dressed in an Emporio Armani cashmere overcoat, H&M “Mama” maternity dress, and vegan leather Stella McCartney tote, six-months-pregnant Meghan delighted staff and volunteers at the animal welfare charity as she toured the facility."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But though tempted to bring Minnie back to Kensington Palace to join her other two rescue pooches, the duchess lamented, “We can’t take another dog before the baby... our hands are too full!”</p><img alt="The Duchess Of Sussex Visits Mayhew" title="The Duchess Of Sussex Visits Mayhew" width=1658 height=2200 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1083257042.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-esp0ot e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">WPA Pool</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>The Duchess of Sussex holds a Jack Russell terrier named Minnie during her visit to Mayhew on January 16.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though Meghan has privately visited the the Mayhew on two previous occasions, her January 16 engagement was an opportunity to meet those who have benefited from the charity’s community work, including care home residents with dementia who have received emotional support from “TheraPaws” dog Roobarb as part of their animal therapy initiative.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Peggy McEachrom told Meghan how the dog had improved her outlook on life through his visits to Lawnfield Care Home, where she currently lives. She also marveled at Meghan’s blossoming bump, jokingly calling her a “fat lady.” Meghan laughed, responding, “I’ll take that!”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In conversation with Wully Struthers, a formerly homeless Pet Refuge service user, Meghan learned more about how the charity supports vulnerable people trying to keep their pets during tough times. His two Staffordshire Bull Terriers, Azzy and Gallis, were cared for by the Mayhew’s animal welfare officers while he worked to change his living circumstances. “They’re like my babies,” Wully told the duchess. “That I understand! That I understand,” she responded, smiling.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Wednesday also offered a chance for the duchess to reunite with dogs she met on previous visits. Foxy, a four-year-old Pomeranian, had just come into care when she last visited, but is now getting ready to leave with a new owner. Cooed Meghan, “She’s so, so sweet.”</p><img alt="The Duchess Of Sussex Visits Mayhew" title="The Duchess Of Sussex Visits Mayhew" width=1614 height=2200 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/meghan-the-duchess-of-sussex-meets-roobarb-during-her-visit-news-photo-1083256976-1547675807.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-esp0ot e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">WPA Pool</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>The Duchess of Sussex meets a dog named Roobarb at Mayhew on January 16.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When meeting the dogs, Meghan spoke about her own experience of adopting. Guy, her beagle, was days away from being euthanized when she rescued him from Toronto’s A Dog’s Dream Rescue in 2015. And Bogart, a Labrador-shepherd mix who is too old to travel and currently lives in Canada with a close friend, was from a shelter in Los Angeles. Harry and Meghan also adopted a black Labrador last summer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“He had been in a kill shelter before,” she said of Guy, who she walks without fail every day. “I remember getting this dog home and he was petrified of even coming to the front door.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A longtime advocate of the “adopt, don’t shop” movement, Meghan’s support of the Mayhew animal charity was something of a no brainier when first learned about their impressive community work last fall. It took just one visit to their humble headquarters in northwest London for her to move forward with a patronage.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“She had read something about our community outreach work and that resonated with her and she got in touch,” CEO Caroline Yates tells BAZAAR.com. “[Animals] are a very important part of her life. She’s a natural.”</p><img alt="The Duchess Of Sussex Visits Mayhew Animal Welfare Charity" title="The Duchess Of Sussex Visits Mayhew Animal Welfare Charity" width=1516 height=2173 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/meghan-duchess-of-sussex-departs-after-visiting-mayhew-news-photo-1083228894-1547675840.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-esp0ot e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Karwai Tang</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>The Duchess of Sussex arrives at Mayhew on January 16.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite being a small organization, 2018 saw the Mayhew handle 1,061 animal welfare cases, rehousing nearly 500 dogs and cats and vaccinating 32,431 dogs against rabies globally. Their international neutering programs in Afghanistan, Georgia, Russia, and India have neutered over 12,000 cats and dogs so far. Mayhew execs are hoping Meghan’s involvement will help them achieve even more this year.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Says Yates, “We’re not a massive charity at the moment but there are massive demands on our services and there is a massive need for our help in the community. Hopefully it will also help with fundraising... We’ve had a lot of interest [since the announcement] so the profile raising and the name is already getting out there.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite entering her final trimester, Meghan is as active as ever. Following the engagement, she and Prince Harry attended the premiere of Cirque du Soleil’s TOTEM at London’s Royal Albert Hall, raising money for Sentebale. And before the month is over, Meghan will attend engagements for two further patronages—the National Theatre and the Association of Commonwealth Universities.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/45770d72-fac8-4474-90bb-36e121ad9a67_1543445615.jpeg alt="Headshot of Omid Scobie" title="Headshot of Omid Scobie" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Omid Scobie is <a href=#>BAZAAR.com</a>’s Royal Editor at Large and has covered the lives and philanthropic work of the younger members of the British Royal Family for over eight years.
