Achievements</span></h2><p>The heavyweight champion, <strong>Will Ospreay</strong>, had an extraordinary career. He has won numerous titles and awards. Some of his achievements that add to his net worth are:</p><ul><li>IWGP World Heavyweight Championship 2020</li><li>NEVER Openweight Championship 2019</li><li>New Japan Cup 2021</li><li>IWGP United States Heavyweight Championship 2022, etc.</li></ul><p>Calculating the wrestler’s achievements, assets, ownerships, and earnings, Will has a <strong>net worth</strong> of around <strong>$100 Million.</strong></p><h2>Early Years and Family of Will Ospreay</h2><p>Will Ospreay was born in Havering, London, England, UK, on May 7, 1993. The names of his parents are currently unknown. His parents are well known to be quite supportive of him, nevertheless.</p><p>Will previously released a video of his parents watching his wrestling battle on TV, for instance. “Fuck me, son, you’ve been working out,” his father said after watching Will wrestle and win the game.</p><p>Does Will have a special place in his heart for his parents? Despite his tendency toward violence, he is a family boy.</p><p>Will rarely gives the public information about his family. The wrestler, though, recently revealed that his father had recently battled cancer.</p><h2>Professional Career of&nbsp; Will Ospreay</h2><p>Will began his career in the UK in 2012 on the independent circuit and is now considered as one of the top professional wrestlers in the world.</p><p>In 2016, he began working for the Japanese organization New Japan Pro Wrestling as a junior heavyweight after receiving AJ Styles’ recommendation.</p><p>It is all the more significant that AJ Styles was able to sign with New Japan Pro Wrestling in the manner he did because he was Will’s idol growing up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-28-2.jpg><p>Will Ospreay looked up to and was inspired by Styles, and the fact that he helped him get to New Japan ties them together.</p><p>Furthermore, Ospreay’s talent for hitting and his capacity to include high-flying elements into his technique do in some ways reflect AJ’s.</p><p>Will became the third IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion after winning the Best of the Super Juniors in 2016 and 2019. Ospreay also captured the NEVER Openweight Championship in 2019.</p><p>The wrestler competed in the G1 Climax, the most amazing NJPW event for heavyweight wrestlers, that same year. In 2020, he changed weight classes and won the IWGP World Heavyweight Championship there.</p><h2>Wrestling Frontline</h2><p>In 2018, Ospreay claimed that Frontline Wrestling will be his promotion. Frontline, according to the wrestler, will be a British Puroresu-style company that seeks to reestablish wrestling as a legitimate sport in England.</p><p>On June 28, 2018, they staged “Build Me An Empire,” their first gathering. Wrestlers typically opt to market themselves after retiring and looking for new ways to contribute to the sport.</p><p>The advancement of Ospreay was just momentary. Will, however, sold Frontline on the first anniversary of the offer. He did this in order to move to Japan and work full-time for New Japan Pro Wrestling.</p><p>But his participation in the activity in the first place shows his interest in the sector.</p><h2><span id=All_Elite_Wrestling_(2022–present) class=mw-headline>All Elite Wrestling</span></h2><p>The All Elite Wrestling edition of AEW Dynamite airing on June 8, 2022, featured Will making his surprising debut. Along with stablemates Aaron Henare, Kyle Fletcher, and Mark Davis of Aussie Open, the wrestler attacked Trent Beretta and FTR.</p><p>This occurred two weeks after Great-O-Khan and Jeff Cobb, teammates on United Empire, made their AEW Dynamite debuts by attacking Roppongi Vice and FTR.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Will-Ospreay-with-Kyle-Fletcher-and-Mark-Davis.jpg><p>On June 10, 2022’s AEW Rampage, Beretta and FTR defeated Davis and Fletcher of the Aussie Open and Will of the United Empire.</p><p>On the June 15 broadcast of the special Road Rager Dynamite episode, Will defeated Dax Harwood in his singles debut match.</p><p>Following the game, Will and his fellow United Empire teammates attacked FTR and Roppongi Vice once more before being stopped by Orange Cassidy, who glared at Ospreay.</p><p>Soon after, a male singles contest for Ospreay’s freshly earned IWGP United States Heavyweight Championship was scheduled for AEW-NJPW: Forbidden Door.</p><p>The wrestler successfully defended the IWGP US Heavyweight Title against Orange Cassidy at AEW-NJPW: Forbidden Door.</p><p>Following the game, Ospreay and Aussie Open attacked Cassidy and Roppongi Vice. Katsuyori Shibata shot the pair to stop them.</p><h2><span id=Professional_wrestling_style_and_persona class=mw-headline>Will Ospreay | Twitter feuds</span></h2><h3>Feud with Vader</h3><p>Vader is regarded as one of the most violent wrestlers in history and a legend in the sport. He didn’t appreciate the well-known 2016 match between Will Ospreay and Ricochet in part because of this.</p><p>In the end, the two of them engaged in a contentious Twitter dispute that received considerable attention. However, they took advantage of their disagreement and engaged in a fight.</p><h2 class=entry-title><a href=# rel=bookmark>Seth Rollins</a> Conflict</h2><p>Along with Vader, Will Ospreay has run into issues on social media with other well-known wrestlers. In response to Seth Rollins’ claim that WWE provided the most passable wrestling in the business, the wrestler once underlined his ability to survive.</p><p>Things immediately spiraled out of control, and Rollins eventually that Ospreay see his bank account as proof.</p><p>WWE fans let Rollins know that they did not like his attitude. Over a week later, Rollins apologized to Ospreay for his comments.</p><p>Will went on to accept the apology and thank Rollins, who he had been following since he was Tyler Black. Following their agreement, neither side pursued their argument further.</p><h2>Conflict with Pollyanna</h2><p>As part of the Speaking Out campaign, Pollyanna, a former wrestler, was accused of being blocked by Will. Ospreay’s friend and fellow Swords of Essex teammate Scott Wainwright was the target of claims from Pollyanna.</p><p>An indie wrestling league, the International Wrestling League (IWL), tweeted that a venue had requested they remove Pollyanna from an event at Ospreay’s request.</p><p>Later, IWL disclosed that the venue had requested her removal rather than Ospreay’s. Later, the IWL Twitter user acknowledged that their interpretation of a “unclear circumstance” served as the pretended proof.</p><h2>Who is the girlfriend of&nbsp; Will Ospreay? Married life and kids.</h2><p><strong>Bea Priestley</strong> and Will Ospreay have been dating since 2017. Beatrice St. Clere Priestley, better known by her ring name Bea Priestley, is a professional wrestler who was born on March 22, 1996, in England and New Zealand.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-27-1.jpg><p>Bea now competes on the <strong><a href=# rel=nofollow>NXT</a> </strong>roster as Blair Davenport while on contract with <strong><a href=# rel=nofollow>WWE</a></strong>.
