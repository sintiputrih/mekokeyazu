After all, WWE doesn’t have a union at all.</p><p>During the press conference after Fastlane, John Cena was asked if Hollywood will get him back once the Strike is over. He confirmed that they will, because he was in the middle of a project that must get back on schedule as soon as they can.</p><p>“They do, they do. I’ve made it perfectly clear that you can’t do both, because of the liability insurance, and if I were to try to juggle both, then that would be selfish, because I would put a lot of people out of work if something happened to me. So, yes, I stopped the project I was in, I can’t even talk about what the project was because of the strike, and we’re in the middle of it. So, as soon as I can get back to work, I get back to work. I don’t control any of that, just crossing my fingers to hope that they can figure that out. In the meantime, I came back to help with my family.”</p><p>The 16x World Champion went on to say, “This isn’t the last one but the last one is on the horizon.” It’s been fun having John Cena back, but it won’t last forever.</p><p>John Cena’s latest run in WWE has been a very fun one to watch. Cena admitted that it exceeded his expectations as well. Only time will tell what he will be able to do before he takes off again, but it’s only a matter of time before that day is upon us.</p><p><a href=# class=acss2c66f>Ringside News</a><span class=acss79fa2>&nbsp;will have complete coverage.
