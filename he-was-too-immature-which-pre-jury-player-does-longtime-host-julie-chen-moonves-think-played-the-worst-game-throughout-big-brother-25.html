He was kind of like a team captain, but then he lost his team. He could have rallied, and he seemed good at competitions.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 data-characters=219 data-current-count=618 data-injectable=true>He’s smart, he’s physical, but he didn’t have the personality,” the longtime host continued, prior to diving into those who had games that were rather forgettable: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kirsten Elwin</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mecole Hayes</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 data-characters=103 data-current-count=103 data-injectable=false>Julie spilled, “Kirsten, hard to judge her.&nbsp;Mecole, she just kind of floated through.”</p><p data-characters=205 data-current-count=308 data-injectable=false>With these three houseguests aside, in the eyes of Julie Chen Moonves, Reilly Smedley was another individual who had a great deal of potential (like Hisam), however, her journey was cut too short to tell.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 data-characters=371 data-current-count=679 data-injectable=true>“Reilly, maybe she could have been, but we didn’t get to see enough,” she explained. “I don’t think she could handle the pressure of the power. She could have been good at all the competitions, but handling the politics of the house and the pressure of the power of being HoH, I think she was a little bit too emotional for that role.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Jared-Fields-Big-Brother.png><p data-characters=219 data-current-count=519 data-injectable=true>While Julie deemed Hisam and Reilly as potentially the strongest pre-jury players, there is one individual who she said definitely did NOT have the best game: son of four-time <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Survivor</a> player <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cirie Fields</a>, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jared Fields</a></strong>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 data-characters=263 data-current-count=263 data-injectable=false>“Not&nbsp;Jared,” Julie stated explicitly. “He was too immature and played too hard, too quickly, rushing through things and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">telling Blue about Cirie being his mom</a>. He just needed to grow up a little bit” — we seriously could not agree more!</p><p data-characters=162 data-current-count=425 data-injectable=true>While Julie Chen Moonves (as well as viewers back home) agree that <a href=#>Jared was messy and hot headed throughout Big Brother 25</a>, he has no regrets about his gameplay.</p><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=266 data-injectable=false>In another <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive interview with Entertainment Weekly</a> upon his exit, Jared revealed, “Everything that happened in my game made me into the player who I was, and I was happy and grateful to be that player, and I was content with the player that I was.”</p><p data-characters=82 data-current-count=348 data-injectable=false>If Jared himself is happy with his gameplay, that’s all that matters, right?</p><p data-characters=264 data-current-count=612 data-injectable=false>Nonetheless, tune into CBS or Paramount Plus for brand new episodes&nbsp;of&nbsp;Big Brother 25&nbsp;every Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday to see how the remainder of the season plays out —&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with a double eviction on the horizon</a>, things are about to get crazy!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ypsYywmKxlpKS8brXMppitraKaeri0yJyfZqiimnqrwdGyZKmkka6ys3nDqJysZZyku6jAyKacZqCfqMFuttSloJ5lk52yr3nMqKanrpWoerW0yKeiZqiclsamsIytn55lp6S%2FtMCMoJimnV2ptbO71KCfqK2kYq%2Bqs4ybqaismJq%2Fbn6UaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
