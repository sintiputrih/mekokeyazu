Unfortunately, this is unlikely to be a priority, as the team is working on a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sequel game called Sons of the Forest</a>, which is currently in Early Access on Steam. The audience and critical response to Sons of the Forest has been positive, so getting that out the door is more important than adding new features to an old game.</p><p data-injection=true><strong>Related:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">How To Get Drinking Water In The Forest</a></p><p>Hopefully, Sons of the Forest will have cross-play or cross-progression in the future. The game is currently only available on PC, so it’s unclear how many platforms it will eventually be running on, but if it comes to PlayStation and Xbox systems, then there might be more options for letting friends play across multiple platforms.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9289d2b1ecf1c035bcc43d953c9bb11b?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Trent Cannon</h3><p class=author-url><a href=#>https://trentcannonblog.wordpress.com/</a></p><p class=author-desc>Trent is a Freelance Writer at Gamepur.
