Even better, he popped the question during a two-week trip to the Caribbean, proposing where he and Lexi first met while on vacation with their families, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“I think she expected it was coming,” the then-23-year-old told Flaunt Magazine (via Us). “Then, she ended up thinking it wasn’t going to happen because I waited a whole week before I asked.”</p><p>Max and Lexi tied the knot in June 2013, and <a href=#>Kristen Stewart</a> — Max’s co-star in the 2004 family action movie Catch That Kid — attended the wedding, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> reported.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“Best weekend of my life,” Max <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> after the nuptials. “Married the most beautiful and amazing woman in the entire world.”</p><p>Max and Lexi have two children.

I got a couple of kids to throw in there and moving around up to Vancouver to shoot a TV show. But I’m young, and I can keep up. I like staying busy, so it works for me.”</p><p>But Fire Country is a passion project for Max, who found inspiration in his Northern California hometown. “I had never tried pitching anything, or even finished writing anything before,” he said. “I’m sort of a little bit of a hummingbird where I’ll start on something, and then I’m off to like another idea. This started as one of those, but then I found myself so locked into it, and a lot of that is because it was personal, so it was easy to work on and create and move forward with.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq65edOhoJ6qmaTBbsPIn5w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
