He launched an online fundraiser and it garnered over $100,000 in just a few days.</p><p class=dh>Kayzen Hunter, 8, visits Waffle House every weekend to have breakfast with his family. They always choose to sit in Devonte Gardner's section, because they get the best care from their favorite waiter.</p><p class=dh>The family instantly felt close to Gardner, who would greet Kayzen with a high-five every time they entered the store. Kayzen never needed to dictate his order again, because Gardner already knew it by heart. The family genuinely <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2023/03/02/waffle-house-arkansas-waiter-fundraiser/ ">believes</a> he's the "nicest person ever," which is why they were eager to help him when they learned his story.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Discovering His Friend's Situation</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>One day, while dining at the restaurant with his grandfather John Donofrio, Kayzen discovered that behind Gardner's kindness and warmth was a lot of personal struggles. At the time, Gardner asked the pair if they knew where he could buy an affordable car to use to get to work.</p><p class=dh>It turned out the waiter had been walking a long distance to and from work every single day. He and his family, consisting of a wife and two young daughters, were living in a motel room after their apartment became uninhabitable.</p><p class=dh>They had been living in a motel for months after discovering their apartment was contaminated with black mold and infested with rats – a deadly combo that they definitely did not want to be exposed to.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Doing Something to Help</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Kayzen couldn't erase his friend's story from his mind, so he immediately told his mom about it when he got home. "We have to start a GoFundMe and help Devonte get a car!" he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2023/03/02/waffle-house-arkansas-waiter-fundraiser/>kept saying.</a></p><p class=dh>He didn't give up on the idea until his mom Vittoria gave in. Their goal was to rake in $5000 in donations so Gardner could purchase a car.</p><p class=dh>Vittoria and Korey were eager to help their son achieve the goal, especially since they knew what it was like to live in a rental house that was contaminated with black mold. In 2019, their family had to relocate because of that particular issue.</p><p class=dh>It took a long time to rebuild their lives after all their belongings were ruined by the mold, but they were able to bounce back. Now, they want to help Devonte do the same.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>The Spirit of Community</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>A local news station picked up the story, and before they knew it, more donations began pouring in. From the initial goal of $5000, they now have over $100,000 in donations for Gardner and his family.</p><p class=dh>The money is more than enough for a car, and will enable Gardner and his family to move out of the motel and live in a more comfortable space for over a year. All this happened without Gardner knowing, which left him stunned.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>With a lot more money at his disposal, Gardner plans to rent a simple apartment, big enough for his family to live comfortably, and purchase a car that would allow him to go to work at ease.</strong></h3><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Gardner's Reaction to the Donations</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Upon discovering what Kayzen had done, Gardner wept. He didn't want to ask anybody for help, so he worked hard in order to provide for his family.</p><p class=dh>Most of the money he earned went to pay for the motel, which charged them $60 a day. His wife, Aissa Shorter, worked at a local fast food restaurant to help pay the bills.</p><p class=dh>Shorter and Gardner worked together to ensure their kids are well cared for. They take opposite shifts so their daughters never have to be alone.</p><p class=dh>Ultimately, their belongings were depleted from having accumulated black mold, but they are slowly working their way back to have all their essentials. Now that they have over $100,000 in donations to help them bounce back, getting the things they need will no longer be a problem.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Inspired by Other People's Generosity</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Gardner vows to continue working at Waffle House, where he is able to meet great people like Kayzen on a daily basis. He enjoys meeting other people through his job, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2023/03/02/waffle-house-arkansas-waiter-fundraiser/>adding:</a></p><p class=dh>"I love the people who come in, especially Kayzen. For this little guy to do this out of the kindness of his heart is really humbling."</p><p class=dh>Gardner believes people donated because they related to what he was going through. He acknowledges that many Americans struggle to pay for their daily expenses, especially since the cost of living has increased in the past year.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Many Related to Gardner's Situation</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Aside from those who could relate to his story, others who donated were people who knew Gardner from work. This included his previous customers who were familiar with how hard the man worked and how he always greeted everyone with a smile.</p><p class=dh>With a lot more money at his disposal, Gardner plans to rent a simple apartment, big enough for his family to live comfortably, and purchase a car that would allow him to go to work at ease.<strong class=bh></strong> "I'm really touched deeply by it all," Gardner <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2023/03/02/waffle-house-arkansas-waiter-fundraiser/>gushed</a>. "And as far as my little buddy goes, he's my best friend for life."</p><p class=dh>With over 2,600 donors, the <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.gofundme.com/f/devonte-get-a-family-car?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=p_cf%20share-flow-1&fbclid=IwAR2P_1TTLKXoGXRCmaCUXaL9v1oLllBt8jz0Vd5joEJD9-FYhLzFTEIZQQc">GoFundMe page</a> organized by the Hunters continues to rake in money every few minutes.
