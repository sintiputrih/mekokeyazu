Are you still here?" Tracee called out over the mic. "Do you want to sing 'Happy Birthday?' Come on down!"</p><p class=Zg>A beaming Beyonce stepped into the spotlight as she took the mic and serenaded the night’s celebrant with her sultry rendition of the iconic birthday tune.</p><p class=Zg>A separate video shared by another guest shows a clearer view of Beyonce singing directly to Diana. Diddy is standing next to Jay-Z’s wife as she belts out the song as nobody else can.</p><p class=Zg>Beyonce considers Diana as one of her major influences in music. This much she t<a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://ew.com/article/2006/09/01/beyonce-tells-us-about-her-influences/>old Entertainment Weekly </a>in 2006. She also portrayed a character inspired by the legendary “Supremes” singer in the film adaptation of “Dreamgirls.” Moreover, she <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.today.com/popculture/cher-diana-ross-inspire-beyonce-s-fashions-wbna27326595>revealed to In Style</a> in 2008 that Diana is one of the fashion icons she looks up to because she “never played it safe.”</p><p class=Zg>It is no surprise then that a day before Diana’s 75th, Beyonce took to her website to <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://beyonce.com>pay tribute to her</a>. “Happy Birthday Diana Ross,” she wrote to accompany a photo of a very young Diana.</p><p class=Zg>The star-studded event in honor of the birthday girl was held at the Warwick in Los Angeles. Other guests included Berry Gordy, Kris Jenner, as well as Diana's son and daughter-in-law Evan Ross and Ashlee Simpson.</p><p class=Zg>Coinciding with her birthday, a documentary is set to be released tilted, “Diana Ross: Her Life Love and Legacy.” The film which is due for screening on March 26 and 29 will reportedly feature her 1983 free concert in Central Park, New York and interviews from friends and family.</p><p class=Zg>While Diana’s documentary is expected to honor her legacy, another documentary that <a class="zd d" href=#>caught her attention</a> recently did the opposite. HBO’s “Leaving Neverland” drew controversy for painting a sour picture of Diana’s good friend, Michael Jackson. Expressing her disappointment, she tweeted “STOP IN THE NAME OF LOVE” as she showed her support for Michael. “I believe and trust that Michael Jackson was and is A magnificent incredible force to me and to many others."</p><p class=Zg>Michael is the godfather of Diana’s son, Evan. Likewise, Diana is the back-up guardian for Michael’s three children. That being said, Diana’s loyalty is with the King of Pop.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpram9iaXqjsdiopZydXai2r7PSZp%2BaqKCueqO10a2fnZmpYrGqrc2aZKuno6h7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
