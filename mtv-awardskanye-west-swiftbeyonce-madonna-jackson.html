There were boos and cries of astonishment when Kanye stormed the stage, grabbing the microphone from Taylor as she accepted the Best Female Music Video. He told her: "Yo Taylor. I'm really happy for you, I'm going to let you finish, but Beyonce had one of the best videos of all time."

The queen of pop accused herself and the world of "abandoning him." She told the crowd: "When I first heard that Michael had died I was in London, days away from the opening of my tour. "All I could think about in that moment was I had abandoned him, that we had abandoned him, that we had allowed this magnificent creature who once set the world on fire to somehow slip through the cracks."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
