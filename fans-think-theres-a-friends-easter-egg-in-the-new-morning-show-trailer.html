Aniston and Witherspoon previously worked together as part of the legendary Green sisters trio — <a href=#>together with Dead To Me star Christina Applegate</a> — on the popular comedy.</p><p>The Morning Show debuted on AppleTv+ in November 2019 and consisted of a ten-episode season. An adaptation of Brian Stelter's book Top of the Morning: Inside the Cutthroat World of Morning TV, the series was developed before the #MeToo movement rose to prominence after the Harvey Weinstein scandal, but was reworked to include it in the storyline.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alongside Witherspoon and Aniston, who also serve as executive producers, the cast features the aforementioned Carell in a controversial role, Billy Crudup, Bel Powley, Mark Duplass, and Gugu Mbatha-Raw, among others.</p><p>AppleTV+ ordered two seasons of the show, for a total of twenty episodes.
