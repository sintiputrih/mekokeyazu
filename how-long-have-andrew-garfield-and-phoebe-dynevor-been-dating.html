However, in keeping with his preference to steer his relationships away from the spotlight, he has not commented on this new turn of events, although it‚Äôs clear he and Dynevor are more than just friends.</p><h2 id=h-when-did-andrew-garfield-and-phoebe-dynevor-meet-and-how-long-have-they-been-together data-injectable=false>When did Andrew Garfield and Phoebe Dynevor meet and how long have they been together?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=685 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by PD üåó (@phoebedynevor)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>Andrew Garfield and Phoebe Dynevor officially cozied up with one another at the GQ Man of the Year Awards in mid-Nov, although they reportedly already knew each other through ‚Äúvarious acquaintances,‚Äù according to The Sun. Cameras were not able to snag a photo of the pair neither at the event nor at the after-party they attended (and left) together.</p><p data-characters=366 data-current-count=728 data-injectable=true>Garfield broke up with model and singer Alyssa Miller earlier this year in April, citing ‚Äúbusy schedules‚Äù as the reason for their split. They were together for several months, meeting in 2021. Before that, Garfield was intertwined with fellow Hollywood A-lister Emma Stone, as well as singer Rita Ora, model Christine Gabel, and actress Shannon Woodward.</p><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>All of his relationships have remained relatively low-key in the eyes of the public, which explains why any cameras did not catch him and Dynevor at the GQ Man of the Year Awards, and why neither has addressed the rumors yet. For her part, Dynevor did post to Instagram photos of herself on the red carpet, but Garfield was noticeably absent from them.</p><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=732 data-injectable=false>It‚Äôs too early to tell whether this new pairing will morph into a full-blown relationship, but we can dream. Either way, it‚Äôll likely be a while before Garfield himself addresses the rumors, if at all. If that‚Äôs the case, we‚Äôll keep our eyes peeled for more juicy information from Dynevor, who, unlike Garfield, is very active on her social media channels.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1sMOMpaann12drrexjJqlnaqVrHqordGfoJ6klGKur7CMqZ%2BonZKaeqXFzZ6tqKpdl7KmuoydmK2hnpx8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
