Storbeck‚Äôs first impression didn‚Äôt leave audiences overly impressed, and some viewers are already warning Lawson away from their bottom pick <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">for season 20</a>.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-spencer-storbeck data-injectable=false>Who is Spencer Storbeck?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Spencer Storbeck (@spencerstorbeck)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=761 data-current-count=1061 data-injectable=true>Storbeck almost instantly inspired rampant memes and passionate takeaways after his entrance into the Bachelorette lineup left many viewers in their feelings. Most of these feelings led to jokes about Storbeck‚Äôs awkward delivery, and warnings for Lawson to ‚Äúrun,‚Äù but these knee-jerk reactions may be unfair. At this point, we still know almost nothing about Spencer‚Äôs background ‚Äî apart from what he‚Äôs revealed in the series so far ‚Äî and people poking fun at his awkward delivery might be off-base in their criticism. After all, widespread speculation that Storbeck is neuro-divergent or suffers from an anxiety disorder could be accurate, and going after someone for feeling uncomfortable on-camera isn‚Äôt the best look.</p><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false>That being said, Storbeck didn‚Äôt come off great in his big Bachelorette debut. His awkward jokes, uncomfortable intensity, and general vibe set many audience members off, and sparked a wave of memes in response. Most highlight Storbeck‚Äôs delivery and Lawson‚Äôs graceful handling of some of their more uncomfortable interactions.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=645 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Charity during this entire conversation with Spencer <a href=#>#TheBachelorette</a> <a href=#>#Bachelorette</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/VBLwDIYtJE</a></p>‚Äî crazy bachelor fan (@crzybachelorfan) <a href=#>June 27, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Charity when the producer tells her she has to give Spencer a rose <a href=#>#TheBachelorette</a> <a href=#>#bachelorette</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/PgU02PfBQs</a></p>‚Äî Laige Pindsey üåå (@iironicaa) <a href=#>June 27, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=602 data-injectable=true>There are plenty of people pushing back on the criticism as well, however, and pointing out that Storbeck may simply be neuroatypical. That didn‚Äôt stop them from sharing bafflement at Lawson‚Äôs decision to grace Storbeck with a rose, particularly in the presence of such fierce competition.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>SPENCER?!?!?!?!?</p><p>SPENCER?!???????!!!!!!!!! <a href=#>#TheBachelorette</a> <a href=#>#bachelorette</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/C4xC3yS802</a></p>‚Äî Justin from Earth-199999 (@Freddiesroomate) <a href=#>June 27, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=361 data-current-count=661 data-injectable=true>We may find plenty more to enjoy in Storbeck over the remainder of the season ‚Äî&nbsp;or, at least, the remainder of his time on it ‚Äî and at least some viewers are willing to give him a shot. More importantly, Lawson is willing to see where their future interactions go, and ‚Äî despite audience concerns ‚Äî it seems he‚Äôs a pretty normal guy overall.</p><p data-characters=575 data-current-count=575 data-injectable=false>Storbeck has been employed by the same company, as a regional sales director for Panthera Dental, since 2021. At 32 years old, he‚Äôs right in Lawson‚Äôs age range, and he already revealed that he has a child from a former relationship. A University of Wyoming graduate and former football player, Storbeck seems like a relatively regular guy ‚Äî albeit one with a bit of an odd on-screen presence. We‚Äôll see if he loosens up in front of the camera <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in future episodes</a> of The Bachelorette season 20, or if those early social media reactions were onto something.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmq6Cau6Sx0Waqraeil7Kkt4yfqailXam1pnnBmpqhnZykv6bA055m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
