"He was like, 'No, I'm fine.' … Even to the point where I said, 'Rock, let them finish.' The LAPD officers finish laying out what his options were. And they said, 'Would you like us to take any action?' And he said, 'No.'"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Los Angeles Police Department previously <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a39559936/chris-rock-not-pressing-charges-will-smith-slap-oscars-2022/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="confirmed to BAZAAR.com" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">confirmed to BAZAAR.com</a> that the comedian refused to press charges against the King Richard actor, despite being visibly shaken by the slap. "Will Smith just smacked the shit out of me," he told the Oscars audience at the time, ironically calling the moment "the greatest moment in the history of television."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In a statement, the LAPD said, "LAPD investigative entities are aware of an incident between two individuals during the Academy Awards program. The incident involved one individual slapping another. The individual involved has declined to file a police report. If the involved party desires a police report at a later date, LAPD will be available to complete an investigative report."<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Following the ceremony in Los Angeles's Dolby Theatre last Sunday, Packer tweeted, "Welp… I said it wouldn’t be boring #Oscars."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He later explained that "Black people have a defiant spirit of laughter when it comes to dealing with pain because there has been so much of it," and added that the incident between Smith and Rock "was a very painful moment" for him "on many levels."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Smith—who smacked Rock after being offended by a G.I.

"I don't have a bunch of shit about what happened, so if you came to hear that, I have a whole show I wrote before this weekend. I'm still kind of processing what happened.
