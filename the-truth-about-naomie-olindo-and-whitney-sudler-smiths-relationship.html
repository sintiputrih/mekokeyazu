Olindo even admitted to "spooning" with Sudler-Smith, much to the shock of her castmates. The news also came as a surprise to Olindo's ex Craig Conover. "I was surprised by each of them. I just didn't see Naomie — ever being with Whitney in that way," he later told <a href=#>ET</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>The two "Southern Charm" stars may have bonded over something in common. Olindo lost her father in December 2019 after he died from esophageal cancer. "I lost a piece of my heart last Friday," she shared on <a href=#>Instagram</a>. She went on to say, "He died peacefully surrounded by people that loved him more than words can explain. I missed him before he was even gone, and I can't imagine what this road will be like.</p><p dir=ltr>During the filming of "Southern Charm" Season 8, Sudler-Smith's father, Lon Hayes Smith, died, per <a href=#>Reality Blurb</a>. Although he chose not to have it be part of his storyline, he did touch upon his father in an episode, per <a href=#>Bravo</a>. In another episode, he is seen thanking Olindo for being there for him. "[You've] been very loyal, a good friend, and just a great shoulder to cry on," <a href=#>he told Olindo</a>. After they had both lost their fathers, perhaps they found comfort in each other, which possibly led to a budding romance.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhkZX1zg46tn55lpKfCtbSMmpmoraRiu6K7zKKcZqecnrulu4yapZ1lp522tbrEsmSsrZShsrN50qagraCjYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
