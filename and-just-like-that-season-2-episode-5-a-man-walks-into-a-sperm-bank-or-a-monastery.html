The age old question is top of mind for single gals Nya Wallace (Karen Pittman), Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) and Seema Patel (Sarita Choudhury) in this week’s episode of “And Just Like That…” on Max. “A sperm bank,” “A monastery,” and a “‘Marvel’ movie” are the only options the Ms. Lonelyhearts can come up with — perhaps explaining their bleak romantic prospects."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Hobbes, Esq. (Cynthia Nixon) burning the candle at both ends as she stays up late in the night with partner Che Diaz (Sara Ramirez) and wakes up at 5 a.m. to — hang out with her son across town?</p><p>Surely, teenaged Brady wouldn’t mind if Miranda didn’t play the early bird every morning in favor of catching up on her beauty sleep?</p><p>The real drama, however, is in the neighborhood of Mirandaland known as Che Town, when their unforgivably-titled sitcom, “Che Pasa,” is tanked by a focus group.</p><p>The critical blow is dealt when a non-binary Brooklynite participant pans Che’s character as a “walking Boomer joke” that felt “phony, sanitized, [and] performative.”</p><p>It’s a criticism not dissimilar from Che’s own issues with the producers’ vision for the show — and not dissimilar from <a href=#>real-life critics’</a> take on the whole <a href=#>character of Che Diaz</a> — but they’re still understandably crushed when ABC pulls the plug on the series.</p><p>Breaking down in front of Miranda that evening, Che asks for a few days to think about things —&nbsp;alone.</p><p>The already itinerant Miranda looks upset over being booted, but between Che’s lifelong aspirations being destroyed in an afternoon and a cushy new NYC apartment that they now have no way of paying for, our haggard Hobbes should understand that Che has bigger problems at the moment — and use the time to get some shut-eye as Nya’s new roommate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Bmamtflrulecmuqq1lnJ64pnnToZitZaOarrS7zWZpZp2gnsCwsMRmbGaZXaKur3nWmqOkq12eu7W7jJpkrKiVp7pursCnomanomKubrnOp5isrJWnxnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
