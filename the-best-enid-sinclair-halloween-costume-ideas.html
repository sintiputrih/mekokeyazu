Now, don’t get us wrong, we love Wednesday in all of her moody glory, but we also have a soft spot for sweet Enid, the girl who hasn’t been swayed by the ways the world attempted to harden her.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=651 data-current-count=651 data-injectable=true>When <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wednesday</a> first premiered on Netflix, fans were overjoyed at an opportunity to go on a new adventure with our favorite Addams family member, and meeting Enid was one of the most exciting pieces of the updated storyline. Enid is everything Wednesday isn’t — at least on the surface; everything from their hair style and color scheme to the tone of their voices is different, but while one is outwardly beaming with emotion, the other is captivated by it in a subdued way. The thing is, the strangers-turned-besties are more alike than one might initially think, and they’re two sides of the most important coin in the Netflix series.</p><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=258 data-injectable=false>With spooky season right around the corner, you might be looking for the perfect costume to don this Halloween, and who better to channel than Enid herself? The costume ideas would be especially stellar if you have a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wednesday of your own</a> to celebrate with.</p><h2 id=h-nevermore-uniform-enid data-injectable=false>“Nevermore Uniform” Enid</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=558 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>First and foremost, what better way to channel the full Wednesday experience than by donning a uniform to the prestigious school? For this look, you’d grab a white button-up, a bowtie, a sweater vest, and the iconic black and blue striped jacket and skirt. Enid pairs this uniform with her signature bob hairstyle in faded pink and blue colors and a 1,000-watt smile.</p><p data-characters=212 data-current-count=586 data-injectable=true>Rocking the Nevermore look would be the most iconic way to honor Wednesday as a whole, and it still allows you a more subdued costume if you’re feeling less-than-bright vibes for your look this Halloween.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>“Poe Cup” Enid</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=481 data-current-count=781 data-injectable=true>The Edgar Allan Poe Cup Enid look has got to be one of our favorites from the entire first season. Enid was so thrilled about the Poe Cup, and her joy only grew when Wednesday agreed to join them. While all of their costumes were fantastic, we love Enid’s because she found a way to ensure that her signature style was still incorporated. Her black costume has vibrant pink stitching throughout, and the gloves she wears follow suit, with bright pink fabric peeking through.</p><p data-characters=143 data-current-count=143 data-injectable=false>She also pairs the outfit with cat ears, face paint, and whiskers. We have a feeling this might be one of the most exciting looks to recreate.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>“Rave’N” Enid</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=443 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=407 data-injectable=true>The Rave’N might not have been the dream night Enid initially hoped for, but her outfit for the dance is absolutely perfect. She shimmers in a darling dress, with perfect accents around her neckline and sleeves, her hair is all a beautiful shade of pink that matches her eyeshadow, she’s got glittered gems beneath her eyes, and she puts the entire look together with a beautiful red lip stain.</p><p data-characters=184 data-current-count=184 data-injectable=false>This look might not be as easy to recreate, but it would be a surefire way to embrace your inner Enid, and you could write a different end to the story for our favorite sparkly girl.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>“Not-so-great first date” Enid</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=484 data-injectable=true><a title=@tenorbuds href=#>@tenorbuds</a><p>This was supposed to be Enid and Ajax’s first date. <a title=wednesday href=#>#wednesday</a> <a title=netflix href=#>#netflix</a> <a title=wednesdayaddams href=#>#wednesdayaddams</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=jennaortega href=#>#jennaortega</a> <a title=enidsinclair href=#>#enidsinclair</a> <a title=ajaxpetropolus href=#>#ajaxpetropolus</a> <a title=tvshow href=#>#tvshow</a> <a title=emmamyers href=#>#emmamyers</a> <a title=georgiefarmer href=#>#georgiefarmer</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - RealRangerTidiane" href=#>♬ original sound – RealRangerTidiane</a></figure><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=263 data-injectable=false>Enid’s first date with Ajax was ruined, and our hearts broke for her; unlucky in love, she didn’t have the easiest road when she was brave enough to put her feelings out there. However, his not showing up for the date was no fault of his own, either.</p><p data-characters=426 data-current-count=689 data-injectable=true>While their first date never happened, she looked super adorable on the night she went to meet Ajax to watch the once-in-every-23-years blue moon with him. She donned a cute pink beret, a sweater vest over a ribbed shirt, and a plaid skirt to tie it all together. This look would be easy to recreate by visiting any local clothing store or even Goodwill, but don’t forget to walk into the party with hearts in your eyes!</p><h2 data-injectable=false>“Kitty has claws” Enid</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=667 data-injectable=true>Enid’s chunky sweaters were our favorite, especially their color schemes. In the “kitty has claws” scene, Enid is rocking an adorable pink, yellow, orange, and white striped sweater with rainbow nails that come out as her “claws.” She’s got minimal makeup, but her eyes still pop, and she’s rocking that signature hairstyle.</p><p data-characters=155 data-current-count=155 data-injectable=false>This would also be an easy enough look to recreate, and don’t forget to pair it with a flower skirt and bust out some dance moves through the night.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>“Wolf out” Enid</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=455 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>Enid had a hard time “wolfing out,” but the moment finally happened when she was wearing what might be our favorite outfit. She had another chunky sweater, this time following the same color scheme with white hearts on the front. She wore an iconic pink blazer over top of it, and her hair colors were more vibrant on this particular evening.</p><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=615 data-injectable=true>This is a costume you could have fun with, as you could pick a different part of the “wolfing out” process to wear for the night, or you could upstage everyone and dart off to a bathroom or bedroom and add more “wolf” to the look as the night went on.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>“Some wolves are late bloomers” Enid</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@theverybestmovieclips href=#>@theverybestmovieclips</a><p><a title=tiktok href=#>#tiktok</a> <a title=movie href=#>#movie</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=wednesday href=#>#wednesday</a> <a title=wednesdayaddams href=#>#wednesdayaddams</a> <a title=anime href=#>#anime</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - bestmovieclips" href=#>♬ original sound – bestmovieclips</a></figure><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=704 data-injectable=true>Listen, we said we love her chunky sweater look, and we meant it. This sweater is gorgeous, with different shapes and blocks of color, and she pairs it with, you guessed it, another fun skirt. Enid’s signature look outside of her Nevermore uniform is a sweater and skirt combo. In addition, she has her long nails as she bleakly describes that being the only real “wolf” power she has.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>“Finally hugging Wednesday” Enid</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=522 data-current-count=822 data-injectable=true>This costume would be the same for her “wolfing out” moment, but it’s after the night’s significant events, and she’s covered in blood. This costume would be best for a friend dressed as Wednesday, because the moment she’s wearing this outfit is as important as the look itself. Wednesday isn’t a hugger, something Enid knew from the moment she met her roommate, but after she worried that Wednesday wasn’t coming back, she couldn’t stop herself from giving her bestie a hug.</p><p data-characters=218 data-current-count=218 data-injectable=false>After a moment, Wednesday pulled away, and then pulled her back in. Both are covered in blood, sweat, and tears; this costume is a culmination of everything that happened on Wednesday so far, and it will be a big one.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMRmmZ6rpGKyr7XDZqqippOhrqq%2BjKGYpaSfrLKmuoycpqyspaKybrXDnpisZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
