The “Back To You” songstress joined her bestie on stage during <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her&nbsp;Reputation&nbsp;tour</a> stop where they performed Sel’s hit “Hands To Myself” together. Taylor even sang the iconic line, “I mean I could, but why would I want to?” The&nbsp;13 Reasons Why producer rocked a ‘Romina’ black strapless sequined, wide leg jumpsuit from the&nbsp;<strong>OSMAN</strong> Fall/Winter 2018 collection&nbsp;for the occasion, and some dark eyeliner that she was still wearing when she left the venue.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>After the epic performance, the former Disney Channel star&nbsp;made the sweetest speech about the 10-time Grammy winner. “She’s been my best friend for 12 years, almost 13. And the reason she has stayed one of my best friends is because this person has never judged a single decision I’ve made,” Selena said. “She’s also met me where I’ve been. She’s encouraged me when I have nothing to be encouraged about. I don’t know if I’d be as strong as I am if I didn’t have you and your family, because you’ve changed my life.” Not gonna lie, who cares about boys when this beautiful female friendship exists? Just saying.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/selena-gomez-goes-braless-leaves-taylor-swift-concert-with-mystery-man-post1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Taylor offered her own heartfelt message about her BFF in an <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram caption</a> connected to a photo of the pair sharing the stage. “To the person I could call at any time of day, who has been there no matter what… you absolutely KILLED IT tonight and everyone was so excited to see you,” the “Delicate” hitmaker wrote. “I love you, and 60,000 people at the Rose Bowl loved you too.” These two are seriously #FriendshipGoals.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWloZH12e5FpZqydnJq7onnGqKSesl2Xv6K4xKyqZqWpqMGmvthmpJqmXamuurjOq2Ssr5mbwW6vzqeanqqkYr2qr9Jo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
