The gist:
Players have found glitch points on maps where they can bypass falling death barriers. While on horseback, you can jump off a cliff at these points and repeatedly swing your weapon to accumulate millions of Runes.The Rune glitches are less about farming particular mobs and more about repeating the same process."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We’re uncertain how players discovered them, but it seems that as long as you’re on horseback while jumping at these points, you will seemingly fall indefinitely.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Players soon learned to repeatedly swing their weapon while falling on horseback, which somehow awarded them millions of Runes within minutes. After <a href=#>farming the Runes</a>, players teleported to a Site of Grace and repeated the process. That sums up just about every viable Rune-jumping glitch today.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTuber JJ FLOPERz</a>, the <strong>Dynasty Mausoleum Entrance Site of Grace in the Underworld</strong> is a prime spot to farm 90 million Runes easily with this glitch. His instructions go pretty in-depth, so we recommend watching the video to see exactly where he’s jumping since it’s easy to mess up.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>To summarize, you’ll head to a far-off ledge from the Site of Grace to jump off and repeatedly swing your weapon as you fall. Eventually, you will receive between one to two million Runes, and then you can teleport back to the Dynasty Mausoleum Entrance to repeat.</p><p>For someone early into Elden Ring, we recommend trying out a <strong>Rune glitch within Liurnia of the Lakes</strong>. It’s one of the earliest glitches near the Converted Tower Site of Grace.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTuber MID 40’s Gamer</a> has an in-depth video about this particular glitch that can be tricky to pull off, so again, we’d advise watching someone performing the glitch first. You can get over 3,680 Runes from this glitch. It isn’t the most lucrative of the bunch, but if you’re hurting for Runes, it doesn’t hurt to try it.</p><p>Other Rune glitches are, arguably, not as reliable. Glitches can be risky business and cause some unexpected issues, but if you're fine with taking a chance, farming Runes this way could save you a load of playtime.</p><p>Elden Ring is now available on PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmrmlsc1mqaKml2K%2FtrrEZp6loaSYtQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
