After graduating from high school, <a href=#>Chad Johnson</a> transferred between multiple colleges as different football teams attempted to recruit him each year. Johnsn won the Fiesta Bowl while playing with Oregon State University and was drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals the following year. From 2001-2010, Mr. Johnson played successfully for the Bengals, but his successes on the field were often overshadowed by what many considered his "diva-like" behavior. His propensity for bragging and his continual disregard for authority made problems for everyone. Though he was named to the Pro Bowl team six times, the Bengals eventually decided to let Johnson go for the health of their team. Chad was hired by the New England Patriots, but played for the team for less than a year before being let go. He was signed by the Miami Dolphins in June 2012, but was released from his contract in August after being arrested for domestic abuse against his reality star wife Evelyn Lozada.</p><p>In November 2012, Johnson again made headlines when the mother of one of his children sued the out of work football player for failing to make child support payments. Johnson allegedly has failed to make his court mandated payment of $5250 for several months in a row. In a June 2013 court filing, Chad reported that every month he loses $45,000. His income today is just $3000 a month but every month he owes $16,000 in child support, $9000 in mortgages, $3000 on food, $3000 on car paymentsâ€¦ In the same court filing, Chad listed his total assets at just under $5 million, including two houses and two luxury cars.</p><p><strong><a href=#>Chad Johnson</a> Salary History:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeTna6lec6cn6ibmaOwsHnJqJ%2Bnq5%2Bjeq%2Bx02auqKqknXpzfZFvZ3A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
