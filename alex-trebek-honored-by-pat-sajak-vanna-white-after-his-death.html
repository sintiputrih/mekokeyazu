He was 80.</p><p>“Jeopardy! is saddened to share that Alex Trebek <a href=#>passed away peacefully at home</a> early this morning, surrounded by family and friends. Thank you, Alex,” read a statement from the game show, which he had hosted since 1984,&nbsp;<a href=#>via Twitter</a>.</p><p>The beloved TV personality <a href=#>went public with his pancreatic cancer diagnosis</a> in March 2019, sharing the heartbreaking news in a YouTube video. Trebek revealed that his cancer was at stage IV.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Normally the prognosis for this is not very encouraging, but I’m gonna fight this and I’m gonna keep working and with the love and support of my family and friends and with the help of your prayers also, I plan to beat the low survival rate statistics for this disease,” he said at the time. “Truth told, I have to because, under the terms of my contract, I have to host Jeopardy! for three more years. So help me! Keep the faith, and we’ll win. We’ll get it done.”</p><p>In March of this year, Trebek marked a major milestone by beating the one-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer patients. “I’d be lying if I said the journey had been an easy one,” he said in <a href=#>a video</a> posted to Jeopardy!’s Twitter page. “There were some good days, but a lot of not-so-good days. I joked with friends that the cancer won’t kill me, the chemo treatments will.”</p><p>Trebek is survived by his wife, <strong>Jean Currivan Trebek</strong>, and their two children, Matthew, 30, and Emily, 27. He was also the father of daughter Nicky.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapJWterW%2BxJucpGWYpLuwvsSdZJuxXaWutXnSmqGao12rrq%2B6wGauoaGkmnqistOeqWagmah6pbHArZ9o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
