And the leading cause of it: Rumors. "At first, it was funny. Then it was frustrating. Because it got really intense where people just weren't letting up," Rihanna told <a href=#>The Guardian</a>. "Then it turned into a 'beef' between me and Beyoncé. I was like, 'Where are these people going with this? This is crazy.'" Rihanna insisted that Beyoncé's always been "supportive," adding, "She's so great."</p><p>In 2010, Rihanna <a href=#>gushed to Tyra Banks</a> about her first Bey encounter. "I could not speak," she admitted. "That's somebody I really looked up to for a long time." Rihanna said Beyoncé passed on some good advice, telling her "to always have fun and be in control."</p><p>Rihanna also confessed that she dreams of Beyoncé getting into her undies. "I mean, Beyoncé got body," she told <a href=#>E! News</a> when asked who she would like to wear her lingerie brand, Savage. "Beyoncé in anybody's panties gonna set it off, but I would rather them be mine." In case of any lingering doubts, Rihanna shot dead the Beyoncé feud rumors once again, admitting she isn't here for made-up drama. "Here's the deal, [gossips] just get so excited to feast on something that's negative. Something that's competitive," she told <a href=#>Vogue.</a> "Something that's, you know, a rivalry. And that's just not what I wake up to."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2xgaIF0e8masGayXZa7pXnRop%2Bapp6WwG6%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9mnLGonJa2r7HDaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
