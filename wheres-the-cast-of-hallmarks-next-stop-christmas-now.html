That very idea is at the premise of a <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hallmark</a></strong> holiday movie, Next Stop, Christmas, and the only thing more stellar than the heartwarming story is the incredible cast that helps bring it to life.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=549 data-current-count=549 data-injectable=true>The Hallmark Channel is known for film and television, which centers around life-altering romance and love stories that highlight bonds that change you, shape you, and make your dreams come true. They often tell stories of people lost in the “grind” or stuck in a place where they can’t see the important things in life, and with just a bit of magic, they’re given a chance to turn it all around. This is the case with Next Stop, Christmas, a Hallmark holiday film that first premiered in 2021 and became a fast fan favorite.</p><p data-characters=297 data-current-count=297 data-injectable=false>Next Stop, Christmas stars the talented Lyndsy Fonseca,&nbsp;Chandler Massey,&nbsp;Lea Thompson,&nbsp;Erika Slezak, and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Christopher Lloyd,</a> many of whom have appeared in several Hallmark Channel Christmas films, but the chemistry between the characters in this one is truly something special.</p><p data-characters=410 data-current-count=707 data-injectable=true>With spooky season soon drawing to a close and everyone dreaming of twinkling lights, carols, and cozy nights in, there’s no better time than the present to start planning your holiday watch-a-thons, and you’ll want to ensure Next Stop, Christmas is at the top of it. So what exactly is this sweet holiday film about, and where are the incredible stars of the project now? Let’s take a look.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What is Next Stop Christmas about?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=584 data-injectable=true>Next Stop, Christmas is one of the Hallmark holiday films that resonates with fans. For as magical as the movies are, this one really strikes a chord with anyone who ever had to let go of first love or took a path they never imagined traveling and often spend time wondering what if.</p><p data-characters=65 data-current-count=65 data-injectable=false>The official synopsis for Next Stop, Christmas reads as follows:</p><p>“Angie is determined to spend Christmas alone but her usual commuter ride turns into a Christmas train that drops her off in her home town in 2011.”</p><p data-characters=529 data-current-count=757 data-injectable=true>Going back to the year 2011 gave Angie a chance to ponder what life might have been if she’d made different decisions, and it also allowed her to embrace the beauty of the life she already has. While it might be easy to look back and wonder what could have been, we can’t get lost in that idea forever. There’s a balance, however, in Next Stop, Christmas, and it’s one that’s interesting and beautiful to uncover as Angie revisits a past life, and sees how subtle differences can change everything.</p><h2 id=h-where-is-the-cast-of-next-stop-christmas-today data-injectable=false>Where is the cast of Next Stop, Christmas today?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=566 data-injectable=true>One of the best things about Hallmark channel films is that the actors and actresses build a natural rapport with one another while filming their first (or one of several) projects together, and the bonds they share off-screen make their on-screen work even better.</p><p data-characters=435 data-current-count=435 data-injectable=true>As mentioned above, Next Stop, Christmas stars the incredibly talented Lyndsy Fonseca,&nbsp;Chandler Massey,&nbsp;Lea Thompson,&nbsp;Erika Slezak, and&nbsp;Christopher Lloyd. All of whom have made a name for themselves before starring in the Hallmark holiday film, and if you’re curious to know what they’ve been up to since they brought us all a hefty dose of Christmas magic a few years ago, we’ve got you covered.</p><ul data-current-count=3918 data-injectable=false><li><strong>Lyndsy Fonesca</strong><br>Fonesca has appeared in many projects prior to Next Stop, Christmas, including made-for-TV films like You Can’t Take My Daughter, Five, and Ordinary Miracles and movies such as Kick-Ass, Hot Tub Time Machine, and Curvature. In the years since Next Stop, Christmas, she’s been in North to Home and will appear in the upcoming project, Spinning Gold. Many may remember Fonesca from her time on <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">How I Met Your Mother</a></strong>, the pop culture staple we all loved — until the finale that many of us tuned out anyway.</li><li><strong>Chandler Massey</strong><br>Massey is best known for his time in Days of Our Lives as Will Horton, and he shines in Next Stop, Christmas as he does in several other Hallmark projects like Heart of the Matter, A Tale of Two Christmases, and The Professional Bridesmaid.</li><li><strong>Lea Thompson</strong><br>Thompson is a well-known actress across the entertainment industry, starring in many films, both made-for-TV and theatrical; some of her most famous roles have been in projects like Howard the Duck, Back to the Future, and Little Women. She also had an integral part in the nine-part Hallmark mystery film series Jane Doe. Since Next Stop, Christmas, Thompson has appeared in Star Trek: Picard and The Spencer Sisters.</li><li><strong>Erika Slezak</strong><br>You might know Slezak from the soap opera One Life to Live and her portrayal of Jean Roberts in the film Full Circle. Her long-running career span in One Life to Live, specifically, won her six Daytime Emmy Awards and served as a significant stepping point in her career, one she’s loved as much as she’s crafted a character for viewers to love. After her role in Next Stop, Christmas, Slezak hasn’t appeared in projects, but fans are hoping to see her in another Hallmark movie soon.</li><li><strong>Christopher Lloyd</strong><br>Hallmark wouldn’t feel like Hallmark without Christopher Lloyd; in fact — the entertainment realm as a whole wouldn’t be nearly as bright without him. From One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest and The Legend of the Lone Ranger to Back to the Future, Dennis the Menace, and Hey! Arnold; Lloyd has carefully perfected characters that fans adore for decades — many that are so influential in pop culture that he’s shaped growing up for us. Lloyd can take a role and make it something memorable with a glance or a phrase, and his work in Next Stop, Christmas was phenomenal. Since the Hallmark Christmas film aired in 2021, Lloyd has been Spirit Halloween: The Movie, The Connors, The Mandalorian, and A Million Little Things, to name a few.<p>If you’ve yet to see Next Stop, Christmas, you can stream it on Prime Video now.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGdoprAbsDHnmScmaOperCyjKGYpaSdlr%2Bsv4ynnLGsXajBsLyMnJ%2BroaOpuqK%2FjKemsGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
