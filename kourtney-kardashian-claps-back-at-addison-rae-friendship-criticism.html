And if you have things in common, it just makes sense. I don’t think that’s anything to really judge people on. I feel like friendships can range from any age and I feel like everyone can relate to people in different ways.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Rae added, “Kourtney and I just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">happen to have a great friendship</a>, which is really fun. She’s been a great person to have in my life. She said in my YouTube video that I had great energy that she liked to be around. I think she has great energy as well and she has so much experience in her life that I can really just look at and kind of learn from.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Kourtney-Kardashian-Claps-Back-at-Criticism-Over-Her-Friendship-With-Addison-Rae.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The social media influencer</a> — who skyrocketed to fame in 2019 for her TikTok videos — told Us Weekly in July that Kardashian has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">helped her navigate her newfound fame.</a></p><p>“The advice I have gotten from hanging around people who have spent time in the spotlight is to always be humble and grateful for all that I am given because I am in a really fortunate position,” she said at the time. “I’m truly thankful for the platform my followers have given me.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakp6Wnwa%2Bx2GaimqqUlsCptcCnZJykkaXAbq7AnKJmmaRirqWwyKymp2WilrJustGinKeco522sXnCq6CtoZOewK57</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
