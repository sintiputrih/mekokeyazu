His admission has led Ann to claim that under law, Joe should be blocked from receiving any money from their son's accounts.</p><p id=evKSZIdoZ5F data-wc=40>In July 2014, one year after Cory's death,&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Ann spoke publicly for the first time</a> about her "horrendous" loss. "Until three days ago, I couldn't look at a picture of Cory so there's been progress," she told Good Morning America.</p><p id=eEtWs3GqjuI data-wc=30>She also revealed that Cory's battle with addiction started in his teenage years; when he was 15, he had an overdose, which Ann said was not unrelated to Joe's absence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/303582381ed8-ann-mcgregor-z.jpg><p id=eQ-18hR8iGib data-wc=41>"He had a lot of emotional things he was trying to figure out," she said. "A lot of it was he really wanted a relationship with his father. I think when a child gets invalidated they keep reaching even harder. "</p><p id=e7mJdaQp2y data-wc=52>They want to find out why. "I remember after Cory’s first OD, the drive we took. All I did was stare into his eyes and hug him and look at him because I had this feeling, I really want him to know, because I'm not going to have him my entire life."</p><p id=e6gFwIbxCcB data-wc=67>"Joe, who was not invited to attend Cory's funeral, <a class=hm-link href=#>also remembered his son</a> on the first anniversary of his death. "I still miss him very much and I still have that empty feeling," he told ET Canada. "Cory was a likeable young man and if he was in the room, you'd be smiling. "He enjoyed life. That's why I was so shocked about the outcome of everything."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yQbmdqamFnf3qCkGiaqKqpYrqwutOeoK2gXaK8tbTEq2Sippiav6rA0macrKyRqbJw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
