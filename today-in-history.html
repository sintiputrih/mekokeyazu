The unrest began after the Arab Spring, a series of anti-government protests that swept across the Middle East and Northern Africa in the 2010s, inspired groups to oppose Assad. Violence broke out, and so far over half a million people have died in the conflict. The civil war also sparked the largest refugee crisis in the world, with 14 million Syrians fleeing to seek asylum in other countries.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony1u8OasGahnmK1qr%2FTqKmyZ52Wv6S0jGps</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
