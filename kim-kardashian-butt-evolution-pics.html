That’s been the question about Kim Kardashian’s famous derriere ever since she came onto the scene as Paris Hilton’s BFF in the mid-aughts. But as her fame grew, so did the apparent size of her tushie, as photos from the era with ones years later show a marked difference in the size of Kim’s booty. Here she’s seen in derriere hugging snakeskin pants on her way to a business meeting in L.A. on Mar. 23, 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>By the time she was a top reality star thanks to ‘Keeping Up With the Kardashians,’ Kim got her sizable tush X-rayed on a 2011 episode&nbsp;so she could prove that she didn’t have butt implants. ‘Today I am gong to have a butt x-ray to prove to the world it’s real. This is a really crazy request but my sisters have dared me to get an ass x-ray because of all the rumors it’s not real,” she explained, adding, “If I were to have a fake ass, wouldn’t it be dimple free?”</p><p>After her sisters read stories about Kim’s ginormous badonkadonk from celebrity blogs during that episode, the reality star responded, “I can’t even take this seriously. I’ve said numerous times I haven’t had plastic surgery, I haven’t had butt implants People just want to write whatever they want to write. Who the hell of a normal person gets butt implants?”</p><p>Kim actually discussed butt injections during an Aug. 2016 live stream on her app, but she doesn’t get them to enhance the size of her rear. Instead she gets shots in her derriere to help treat her psoriasis symptoms. “I went to go get a cortisone shot in my butt. I lived right behind Kitson [a now-closed boutique in Los Angeles near Cedars-Sinai Hospital]. One of my neighbors was a dermatologist at Cedars. I go in there and he’s like, ‘There’s a one in a billion chance that you will get a huge indent in your butt.’ Of course, I get a huge indent on my butt.” Kim continued, “There is a picture of me in Miami wearing an electric blue dress, and another picture of me walking down Robertson [Boulevard]. You see the indent. And I think that’s when the rumors started: ‘She’s had implants.’” Check out our gallery to see Kim’s butt evolution over the years.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGinopujZLiquYykmKuckai1qq3NZpmurKRisre7y66roqeeYr2qr9Jo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
