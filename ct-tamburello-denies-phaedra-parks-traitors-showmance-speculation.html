I loved her because she’s a cornball. She was great. I would say there was a sense of sincerity, for sure. But it was also playing a game, you know?”</p><p class=p3>CT, a <i>Challenge </i>vet, was<a href=#> one of the contestants</a> on season 2 of <i>The Traitors</i>. While filming season 2 in Scotland, he got close to Phaedra, 50. Many faithful viewers (and fellow contestants!) clocked CT and Phaedra’s chemistry instantly.</p><p class=p3>“I ship it,” former Bachelor <strong>Peter Weber</strong> <a href=#>exclusively told <i>Us Weekly </i></a>after his banishment from the game earlier this month. “I think they’re really cute together. They had some good chemistry. Who knows what the future holds with them?”</p><p class=p3>Despite Peter’s high hopes, CT wasn’t willing to sacrifice the game <a href=#>for his bond</a> with the <i>Real Housewives of Atlanta </i>alum. After learning that Phaedra was a Traitor, CT voted to banish her from the castle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-Traitors-CT-Tamburello-Says-Nothing-Real-Happened-With-Phaedra-Parks-Despite-Showmance-Rumors.jpg><p class=p3>“Honestly I have too much respect for her to try to turn it into something it’s not, just to try to be a flash in the pan,” he told <i>EW</i>. “I don’t think that would be fair, I don’t think that’s the right thing to do. I mean, what would I do, move to Atlanta? I can’t do that.”</p><p class=p3>CT’s votes paid off in the long run as he was <a href=#>named one of the winners</a> alongside <strong>Trishelle Cannatella</strong> and they opted to split the cash prize.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p3>“It’s a really good [game],” he gushed on Friday. “I have to say, it takes working smarter not harder to a new level in this game. I really enjoyed it because it was more of a political game.”</p><p class=p3>He continued, “It wasn’t just who’s the fastest, or the strongest, or who could swim the deepest, or who has the guts to jump out of a perfectly good plane or get thrown off a cliff. It’s different. I did appreciate this game because … there was a lot more deeper strategy as time evolved. It went from everyone fighting to get a shield to whoever gets it, ‘don’t tell anybody.’ And then planting the seeds, Faithfuls are playing Traitor games, and Traitors are playing Faithful games. And then every time somebody got banished or murdered, it changed the dynamic of the game.”</p><p class=p4><span class=s1><i>The Traitors </i>season 2 and the postmortem cast reunion are currently streaming on Peacock.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqtZaSWuqPB0Z6jpaddmbKvtcSsZKmgkZqxs62MqZiro6NiwbOtyK2mq6tdqLWww8yapZydXai9pq%2FUpZitoZ%2BjfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
