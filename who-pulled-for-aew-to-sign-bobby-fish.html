WWE’s release of Bobby Fish shocked NXT’s system in a bad way. He never made it to NXT 2.0, but now he has another company to move up the rankings; one where he seemingly has a brighter future."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He never made it to NXT 2.0, but now he has another company to move up the rankings; one where he seemingly has a brighter future.</p><p>According to the <a href=#>Wrestling Observer Newsletter,</a> Bobby Fish’s AEW arrival was thanks to Nick and Matt Jackson. They reportedly recommended Bobby Fish and assisted in getting that deal together.</p><p>The Bobby Fish deal (he has signed a full-time deal and had done so but the announcement was withheld until after his debut match with Sammy Guevara because they wanted to position it as an outsider coming and trying to win their deal and it stemming from a social media callout as opposed to a guy under contract and a regular match being made) was recommended and largely put together by The Young Bucks.&nbsp;</p><p>Bobby Fish did not win his first AEW match, a TNT Title contest against Sammy Guevara, but there will be plenty more matches to come for him. He might also end up battling with Adam Cole, and that would be a contest worth watching with a ton of Undisputed Era history to unravel.</p><p>AEW can’t sign everyone that WWE releases, but they couldn’t pass on Bobby Fish. We’ll have to see what’s next for Bobby Fish in AEW. He is certainly off to a good start. Odds are fans will see much more of him in Tony Khan’s company.</p><p><strong>What’s your take on this story?
