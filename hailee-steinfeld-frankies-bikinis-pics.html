She had her arms up with her hands clasped together and above her head and she showed off a pretty smile. A great view of the hills could be seen in the background and she looked as relaxed as could be.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Hailee-Steinfeld-Frankies-Bikinis-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Another bikini she posed in was a pink string one. In the photo for that choice, her hair was wet while she wore the same jewelry she did in the other photos and had her head turned over one shoulder. She also had one leg out in front of her as one arm was across her waist and the other was up and bent with her hand resting on the front of her head. She had a serious expression on her face as her eyes looked over to the side.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Hailee-Steinfeld-Frankies-Bikinis-embed-4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Two <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>other bikinis</a> she posed in included a blue, green, and pink floral patterned one and a pink one with multi-colored stripes. In a photo for the former, she sat on a white towel while atop a building and had a radio next to her. She accessorized with two bracelets, rings, and hoop earrings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Hailee-Steinfeld-Frankies-Bikinis-embed-5.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>In the photo for the other choice, she sat inside in front of a screen while holding up a record as a record player and other records were on the floor next to her. A TV that was set on a small stand and a yellow corded phone was also in the room near her.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Hailee’s latest promotional bikini photos may be incredible, but it’s not the first time she’s wowed in a swimsuit. The actress got a lot of attention back in Apr. when she took to Instagram to share photos of herself relaxing under the sun while wearing a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>light turquoise two-piece</a> under a white top that was tied above the waist and jeans. She topped the look off with a matching bucket hat.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>We look forward to seeing more of Hailee’s awesome bikini photos in the future!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH10e49rZqGZmaGypnnSrZyippaauaV5xauYp6OZmsBursikoKeho2K9qq%2FSaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
