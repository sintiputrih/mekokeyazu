The reality show revolved around two co-investigators, Grant Wilson and Jason Hawes, as they investigated paranormal occurrences.

It was up to fans to decide whether the encounter the paranormal detectives investigated was real or fake. The show’s popularity enabled it to run for over ten seasons on the network before it went off the air in 2016. After a three year hiatus, the popular reality show is making a comeback in television.

The show was so popular and well-received that it resulted in the birth of several spin-off shows. It also led to the rise of haunted landmarks as fans rushed to visit sites the investigators had visited.</p><p>It is fair to say that Ghost Hunters propelled the network right to the top, as it brought it in millions of viewers with every episode.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-6582 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/realitystarfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Ghost-Hunters-cast.jpg alt="Image of Ghost Hunters cast Jason Hawes, Steve Gonsalves, and Dave Tango " width=600 height=304 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>Fans were shocked and in disbelief at the news, but Jason went on to promise that this would not be the end.
