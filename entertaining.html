For my money, though, portobellos really work better in dog form than in burger-form. They get more fully covered in the tangy, savory marinade, and (because they’re thinner strips) they cook a lot more quickly and more evenly. Portobello Veggie Dog Recipe Ingredients Growing up around Chicago, hot dogs were never taken lightly. A good Chicago dog has a myriad of components, including mustard, onions, a whole pickle, peppers, and more. This…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>In case I haven’t mentioned it before – it’s pretty hot here. I’ve been eating watermelon like crazy because, well, I think it just might be the most refreshing fruit on the planet. I had been thinking of making watermelon margaritas until I had the most refreshing elderflower & vodka watermelon cocktail made by the&nbsp;Tipsy Texan&nbsp;a few weeks ago at the opening of&nbsp;Métier Cook’s Supply&nbsp;(a really cute kitchen supply store, btw – if you’re in Austin, go check it out). This is definitely a simplified version&nbsp;but I get impatient to make cocktails that have&nbsp;more than just a few easy ingredients.…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Happy almost 4th of July! Jack and I just got back from a long week in Chicago so didn’t have time to get my flag-cake on… (not that I’ve ever made a flag cake, but there’s always next year). Since the internet seems to be blowing up with food coloring, I thought I’d take a different approach to “red and white” and share a few of my favorite summer wines. These are all very food-friendly. I’ve made some pairing suggestions but, really, they’re very versatile – perfect for any weekend picnic or cookout. (Also, they’re all under $20). Available at…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE POST >>>></a><p>When someone asks you if they can come over and throw a dinner party for you and your friends, you say yes. Resoundingly, yes. To be honest, I struggle with throwing dinner parties – they’re a LOT of work and at the end of each one I always say to Jack “let’s just meet friends at a restaurant next time.”&nbsp;My friend Anna – from The Yellow Table – however, is a pro. She’s on a mission to make this year “the year of the dinner party.” She just spent a month driving from NYC to LA throwing 8 (EIGHT!) dinner…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE POST >>>></a><p>Now that it’s nearly summer, I’ve been making more and more things with less and less ingredients. Lately, I’ve been in love with this juicy little blackberry bite – it’s simple, sweet & bright, with an unexpected savory note from the thyme leaves. These would be beautiful (not to mention ridiculously easy to assemble) for any last minute cocktail party. The only thing missing here: a patio & a few glasses of prosecco. It’s 5 o’ clock somewhere right?</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Can you believe Thanksgiving is next week?! Neither can I… although we’ve been cooking up a storm of comfort foods in order to post recipes here before the holiday. By this time next week I’m sure I’ll be craving sushi rather than stuffing. But until then… here’s a bunch of recipe inspiration in case you’re in need of T-day ideas: pictured above: Roasted Squash with Apple Salsa&nbsp; / &nbsp;Roasted Cauliflower & Leek Soup Poblano Cornbread Stuffing&nbsp; / &nbsp;Roasted Beet Pear & Walnut Salad Butternut Squash & Leek Risotto&nbsp; / &nbsp;Quinoa Stuffed Acorn Squash Apple Spice Cocktails&nbsp; / &nbsp;Mini Vegan Pumpkin…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE POST >>>></a><p>Whether you celebrate Thanksgiving, Friends-giving, or my personal favorite holiday –&nbsp;random Sunday&nbsp;– here’s your fall party cocktail.&nbsp;It’ll make you look like a good put-together host because you’ll have it ready as your guests walk through the door. No one has to know that you made (most of) it the day before. This is full of warm fall spices but it’s actually pretty light and refreshing. Crisp vodka gets mixed with sweet spiced apple juice… and a squeeze of lemon pulls it all together (doesn’t it always?). Serve with apple slices, cinnamon sticks, and star anise, because aren’t those little stars…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Happy weekend! I just wanted to pop in for a minute and share this easy recipe for the spicy margaritas we served at our&nbsp;margarita party a few weeks ago. They were such a big hit – &nbsp;tart, smooth, not too sweet, and most importantly – spicy.&nbsp;The perfect refreshing cocktail for one last summer party! photos #1 and #3 by Chris Perez of Citygram Magazine</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I can’t think of a better way to end the summer than with good friends & spicy drinks! A&nbsp;few weekends ago we had this fun little margarita party for&nbsp;Refinery 29&nbsp;and&nbsp;Grand Marnier. I made a jalapeño version of the classic Grand Margarita. Let’s just say, no one left until every drop was gone.</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE POST >>>></a><p>Happy weekend everyone!
