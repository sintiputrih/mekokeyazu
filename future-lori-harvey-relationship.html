That's because there were hints on social media that they were a doting duo. Fans weren't sure whether to believe the rumors, until socialite, Lori, was seen attending Future's 36th birthday party in November. This appeared to confirm the fact that Future was&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">off the market</a>...again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's no secret that the Life Is Good chart-topper has had a lot of relationships in the past - he's welcomed six children over the years, with six different women, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">including R&B singer, Ciara</a>. He dated Ciara between 2013 and 2015 - she gave birth to her firstborn, Future Jr., in May of 2014.</p><p>But fans are having trouble believing that Future is a changed man. Still, he's been plastering photos of Lori on his Instagram and that is quite unusual for him, since he's not the type to showcase his romances for the world to see. He's spoiled Lori rotten with designer gifts for Christmas, a birthday vacation to Jamaica, and a recent trip to a resort in Utah. There are also rumors circulating that they're expecting their first child.</p><p>But what are the facts about this pair's relationship?

Reports had already been circulating, claiming that the two were secretly seeing one another. However, things weren’t clear until she showed up to her beau’s party.</p><h2 id=they-ve-been-on-plenty-of-vacations-together><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>They’ve Been On Plenty Of Vacations Together</span></h2><p class=p1>Since rumors concerning their romance surfaced, Lori and Future have quite literally <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">traveled the world together</a>. From Jamaica to a short vacation at a resort in Utah, this close-knit couple has made the most of their time together so far. One can only wonder where Future will take Lori next time, or where she'll take him.</p><h2 id=she-supported-future-at-a-concert-in-nigeria><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>She Supported Future At A Concert In Nigeria</span></h2><p class=p1>When Future was booked to perform at an event in Lagos, Nigeria at the end of 2019, Lori was right there to support her man. It should be noted that neither of them had confirmed or denied their relationship at that point in time! However, given how much time Lori was spending with the ‘Low Life’ rapper, it seemed apparent they were dating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here Are 20 Photos Of Impressive Homes These Rappers Live In</a></span></p><p>Future Is Friends With Her Ex-Boyfriend, Diddy</p><p class=p1>What makes things a little awkward about their romance is that Future has been a longtime friend to Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs, who was romantically linked to the Lori just a few months before she moved on with her new beau.

Eagle-eyed fans were able to spot what appeared to be a baby sonogram on her shelf, leading many to think she had a bun in the oven. But judging by Lori’s recent bikini photos on Instagram, she appears to be anything but pregnant.</p><h2 id=future-helped-celebrate-her-23rd-birthday-in-jamaica><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Future Helped Celebrate Her 23rd Birthday In Jamaica</span></h2><p class=p1>When Lori Harvey celebrated her 23rd birthday in Jamaica, she certainly wasn’t going to ring in the New Year without her man by her side.
