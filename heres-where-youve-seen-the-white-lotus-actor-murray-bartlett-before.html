He played the roguish thief-turned-criminal “consultant” (and bus boy) on the series for two years before departing for greener pastures.</p><p class=has-medium-font-size data-characters=7 data-current-count=7 data-injectable=false><strong>Looking</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=307 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=464 data-current-count=771 data-injectable=true>Bartlett took on his most significant role yet in <a href=#>Looking</a> where he played lifelong waiter/sommelier Dom Basaluzzo for all sixteen episodes of the series. Bartlett was drawn to play the dissatisfied and lovelorn Dom for the rare opportunity to play a gay man in his forties on TV (Bartlett is also openly gay). Dom was, to his mind, a sort of spiritual opposite, and a chance to play someone that, “for the grace of God” could easily have been himself.</p><p class=has-medium-font-size data-characters=17 data-current-count=17 data-injectable=false><strong>Tales of the City</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=317 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=804 data-current-count=1121 data-injectable=true>Bartlett appeared in his first Netflix project in 2019’s relaunch of Armistead Maupin’s Tales of the City series, picking up the story after 2001’s Further Tales of the City. Bartlett played Michael “Mouse” Tolliver, best friend of protagonist Mary Ann Singleton and erstwhile dweller at the series locus, the boarding house of Anna Madrigal at 28 Barbary Lane. According to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Post</a>, Bartlett was a fan of the original show, having lived in San Francisco himself in the 1990s. “What I felt connected to was the sense of family in Barbary Lane,” he says. “I was in my 20s. I don’t know if [it was because] I was similar to Michael Tolliver or where he was at in his life. The show had such a beautiful sense of community and I felt that when I came here.”</p><p class=has-medium-font-size data-characters=8 data-current-count=8 data-injectable=false><strong>Physical</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=308 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=439 data-current-count=747 data-injectable=false>In one of his most recent efforts, Bartlett joined the cast of Apple TV Plus’ Physical for its second season which aired this summer. Bartlett plays aerobics instructor Vinnie Green in the series. The relentless and exuberant infomercial guru served as an antagonist for Rose Byrne’s Sheila Rubin. Even if you didn’t remember him for his critically-lauded performance, you would definitely remember those workout shorts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1pr7ErGSwoJWnsm7Fzq6tnmWjmrKvedOhnGavmJ7BpnnLqKuuq12WsLW70WakrqqilsZursCrq6WdpKl6o7HFqKmeZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
