According to him, he was just "an innocent bystander," and didn't deserve the alleged attack. Amid chatter about the incident, a member of Braxton's team, LeTroy, <a href=# rel>spoke out</a>.

He recently opened up about the hate he's been receiving, revealing that her fans have even started to show up at his house. LeTroy says he's in fear for his safety, but refuses to stay silent when it comes to calling out "abusers." He went on to share a screenshot of a DM he received, and while the user who sent it has been hidden, it was seemingly sent by someone else on Tamar's team.</p><p>They're seen telling LeTroy that they <a href=# rel>"would hate to see anything happen" to him</a>, and advising him to hire security. "The tour is apparently more important than my safety which is why nobody is saying anything," he captioned the screenshot. "Hope yall enjoy. See yall."
