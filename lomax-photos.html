But this latest journey would be a bit more high-tech, with actual recordings to show for it.</p><p>But a lesser-known element of the Lomax family's efforts were the hundreds of snapshots they took along the way, often (but not always) of the singers and musicians in action. Sometimes the curious folklorists captured everyday scenes such as baptisms in ponds, children at play, and prisoners at work.</p><p>The gallery above, however, is a collection of Lomax family photographs of the amateur artists in action or posing proudly with their instruments. Some remained amateurs, known only for the recordings that the Lomax family made, while others — such as the legendary Blind Willie McTell — continued to record into the 1950s.</p><p>In the middle of the family's historic endeavor in 1940, 25-year-old Alan Lomax declared on the radio, "The essence of America lies not in the headlined heroes, but in the everyday folks who live and die unknown, yet leave their dreams as legacies."</p><p>These photographs highlight the diverse faces behind the field recordings, including figures such as guitarist Joe Harris and mandolin player Kid West, who recorded 11 blues and ragtime songs with the Lomax family and then quietly left that modest spotlight, never to record their work again, their dreams captured on wax as a legacy that lives on to this day.</p><p>Next, check out more Lomax family photos chronicling the <a href=#>beginning of the blues</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonytu8yar2aomKTBsL8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
