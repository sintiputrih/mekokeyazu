“Oh my God. She’s at our house all the time and she’s so respectful. She will be like, ‘Can I come by?’ And I’m like, ‘Patsy, just come by. You can always come. Every day,’” Prinsloo told Us Weekly at the Rachel Zoe and Irena Medavoy shopping event on Monday, December 10."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The nonprofit works to raise money for organizations focused on the mental health of children. “It’s just an amazing platform,” Prinsloo gushed. “I’m happy that my mother-in-law is part of a beautiful thing.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Prinsloo and the Maroon Five frontman, 39, hope to raise children who are just as big-hearted and kind as Patsy. “It’s all about manners,” she explained to Us. “My kids are always like, ‘Please and thank you.’ I’m like a crazy person, but I think at this stage of their lives, manners matter. When they get older, it’s about accepting people, like, ‘You are who are you. You are beautiful no matter what.’”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>At home —&nbsp;the couple live in Los Angeles — Levine is the firmer parent. This came as a surprise to Prinsloo. “I thought I was going to be the strict one, but he’s actually stricter than me,” she revealed. One of Levine’s rules: No&nbsp;TV during breakfast because it will become a habit.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“He love</span><span class=s2>s </span><span class=s1>one-on-one time with them, so he takes Dusty to coffee every morning,” the Namibia-born beauty told Us. “He’s a very hands-on dad. It’s awesome. I’m lucky.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The Voice coach is also a pretty terrific partner. For Prinsloo’s 30th birthday in May, he whisked her away on five-day surprise vacation.&nbsp;</span><span class=s2>“</span><span class=s1>Without the kids!” she gushed. “It was the first time we were away from both of them and honestly, my mind is still blown.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Though Prinsloo and the Grammy winner won’t be announcing baby No. 3 any time soon (she told Us on Monday that one of her goals for 2019 is to “not get pregnant”),&nbsp;the pair&nbsp;</span><span class=s2>do&nbsp;</span><span class=s1>hope to expand their family at at some point.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I definitely would want to try for a boy, but if I have all girls, I’ll be happy,” she shared.</span><span class=s2>&nbsp;</span><span class=s1>“I definitely want these two to grow up a little&nbsp;and experience the two of them together before we have another.
