Earlier this summer, <a href=#><strong>Shannon Beador</strong> </a>revealed that Dubrow was on her own in the ongoing drama with her castmates on RHOC. “I think at times [Heather] had people behind her but for the most part … she was on her own,” Beador, 59, exclusively told Us in June.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Heather-Dubrow-Says-Tamra-Judge-Was-Clearly-Two-Faced-On-This-Season-of-RHOC-284.jpg><p class=x_MsoNormal>In response to the disconnect between herself, Beador and the rest of the RHOC cast, Dubrow pointed out the ongoing narrative that she was trash-talking Beador’s ex, <a href=#><strong>John Janssen</strong></a>, and described herself as “the whipping boy” this season.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=x_MsoNormal>“Everyone’s saying, Heather’s saying it,” Dubrow told Us. “I want you to pay close attention tonight to conversations that <a href=#><strong>Emily [Simpson]</strong></a> has with Shannon and everyone has with each other, and you’ll see that that’s not true.”</p><p class=x_MsoNormal>Dubrow added, “I don’t think I understood in the moment how south everything was going,” the reality star admitted about her friendships. “And just when I thought it was safe to go back in the water, it was not. I don’t know, maybe I’m a moron.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmhp5OoeqmxwK2fnqpdmcKjvs6wZJ2Zqah6ta3Mq5hmoqWZtKZ51pqqZpucmq6zuNhmq7CnXZuupLHDaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
