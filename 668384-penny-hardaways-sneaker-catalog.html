The former Orland Magic star could be seen in many commercials. As well as being one of the top-marketed athletes in the league. However, the biggest impact Hardaway's biggest impact on the game <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">may have been his sneakers</a>. At the height of his career, no one other than <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel="nofollow noopener">Michael Jordan</a> was moving sneakers like Penny. Recently, the Memphis Tigers head coach discussed what his sneakers have meant to him.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In an interview with Complex, Hardaway took a stroll down memory way. Penny's iconic brand swept the culture in the '90s. However, the brand is still doing very well in today's era. 90s culture has become a rather popular brand for nostalgia purposes. Penny mentioned how important his sneakers were to him and the game. However, Hardaway made a bold claim about his line of sneakers. In the video, Hardaway lays claim to the thought that he has the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">greatest catalog of shoes in the game</a>.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-penny-hardaway-stakes-claim-in-sneaker-pride>Penny Hardaway Stakes Claim In Sneaker Pride</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The former NBA All-Star is ready to go to war with <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">any other signature shoe</a>. Except for Michael Jordan. Jordan's brand has long been the king of the sneaker game. So, it would make sense to avoid that matchup. However, Penny believes his line of signature shoes could top anyone else's. Fans of Hardaway's sneakers quickly came to the defense of Penny's statement. While others feel he may just be hyping up his brand. Whatever the case may be, no one can question his place in sneaker history.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The former Magic star's sneakers are still a hot commodity on the market. Including his original pair and the 'Air Penny V's' still being top sellers for his brand. The sneaker game has grown exponentially in the last two decades. As evident by <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel="nofollow noopener">Nike</a>'s recent lifetime contract with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kevin Durant</a>. However, if you had to choose just one. Which signature shoe brand would be the greatest of all time? Excluding the Jordan Brand, of course. Let us know which signature shoe is your favorite in the comments.
