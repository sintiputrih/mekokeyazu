John was also a prolific rusher of the ball, being one of only two players ever to score a rushing touchdown in four different Super Bowls (the other being Thurman Thomas) and the only quarterback to do so. He is also only one of two quarterbacks (the other being Peyton Manning, also with the Denver Broncos) to retire after a Super Bowl victory.</p><p>John set several career records for passing attempts and completions while at Stanford and also received All-American honors. He was the first selection in the 1983 NFL Draft, famously known as the quarterback class of 1983, where John was taken by the Baltimore Colts before being traded to the Denver Broncos.</p><p>In January 1987, John embarked on one of the most notable performances in sports and in NFL history, helping engineer a 98-yard, game-tying touchdown drive in the AFC Championship Game against the Cleveland Browns, a moment later dubbed “The Drive”. Following that game in Cleveland, Elway along with the Broncos lost in Super Bowl XXI to the New York Giants.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=john-elway-age></span>John Elway Age<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Elway is 61 years old as of 2021, he was born on June 28, 1960, in Port Angeles, Washington, the United States as John Albert Elway Jr.</strong> <strong>He celebrates his birthday on June 28, every year</strong>, and his birth sign is Cancer.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=john-elway-height></span>John Elway Height<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Elway stands at a height of 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m) tall</strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=john-elway-weight></span>John Elway Weight<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Elway has a weight of&nbsp;98 kgs (215 lb)</strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=john-elway-education></span>John Elway Education<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Elway graduated from Granada Hills Charter High School, and he, therefore, joined Stanford University where he graduated with a bachelor’s degree in economics, and where he is a member of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=john-elway-family></span>John Elway Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>John was born in Port Angeles, the Washington United States to Jack Elway and Janet Elway.

The local newspapers ran a section that was called “The Elway Watch.” He debuted for the Broncos in the 1983 season opener against the Pittsburgh Steelers at Three Rivers Stadium. He was sacked for the first time in his NFL career at the hands of linebacker and fellow Hall of Famer Jack Lambert.</p><p>In his first game, Elway was relieved by veteran quarterback Steve DeBerg, who led the Broncos to a victory. His second game was also on the road at Baltimore and was spirited by his rejection of the franchise. In what would turn out to be Elway’s only professional game in Baltimore, he was again relieved in a close game by DeBerg, who led the Broncos to another win.</p><p>In early October, DeBerg was named the starter by third-year head coach Dan Reeves for the remainder of the season, but a shoulder injury brought Elway back a month later. Although the Broncos were playoff contenders for his early years, Elway went through the normal growing pains of a young NFL quarterback.</p><p>In the 1986 season, Elway led the Broncos to Super Bowl XXI, after defeating the Cleveland Browns on a famous possession at the end of the fourth quarter that became known as “The Drive.” (In a span of 5 minutes and 2 seconds, Elway led his team 98 yards to tie the game with 37 seconds left in regulation. The Broncos went on to win the game in overtime.) Elway and the Broncos started out the Super Bowl against the New York Giants very well, building a 10–7 lead and then driving to the Giants 1-yard line in the second quarter.</p><p>However, the Broncos lost five yards on their next three plays and came up empty after kicker Rich Karlis missed the field goal attempt. From that point on, the rest of the game went downhill for the Broncos. Elway was sacked in the end zone for a safety on the Broncos’ ensuing possession, cutting their lead to 10–9.</p><p>Then in the second half, the Giants scored 30 points and ended up winning the game 39–20. Still, Elway had an impressive performance, throwing for 304 yards and a touchdown, with one interception, while also leading Denver in rushing with 27 yards and a touchdown on the ground</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=john-elway-draft></span>John Elway Draft<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Baltimore Colts had the first overall pick in the 1983 NFL Draft. John was wary of playing for the Colts, among the worst teams in the league at the time, and his father advised him against playing for head coach Frank Kush, who had a reputation as a harsh taskmaster. While John preferred football, his agent Marvin Demoff later stated that baseball was “a true option” for him at the time. The possibility gave John leverage in negotiations with the Colts.</p><p>Worried that the Colts would waste their pick, team owner Robert Irsay began negotiating with the Denver Broncos before the draft. His team was interested in offensive lineman Chris Hinton, who the Broncos had chosen as the fourth pick in the first round. On May 2, Irsay and Accorsi agreed to trade John for Hinton, backup quarterback Mark Herrmann, and a first-round pick in the 1984 Draft, which turned into offensive lineman Ron Solt.</p><p>The Colts’ controversial relocation to Indianapolis the following year would later prove to somewhat vindicate Jack Elway’s concerns, as well as that franchise would largely struggle until the arrival of Peyton Manning during Elway’s last season as a player.</p><h1 style=text-align:center>Frequently Asked Questions About John Elway</h1><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-john-elway></span>Who is John Elway?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>John is an American professional football executive and former quarterback who is the president of football operations for the Denver Broncos of the National Football League (NFL).</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-john-elway></span>How old is John Elway?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Elway is 61 years old as of 2021, he was born on June 28, 1960, in Port Angeles, Washington, the United States as John Albert Elway Jr.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-tall-is-john-elway></span>How tall is John Elway?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Elway stands at a height of 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m) tall</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-john-elway-married></span>Is John Elway married?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Elway has a weight of&nbsp;98 kgs (215 lb)</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-much-is-john-elway-worth></span>How much is John Elway worth?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Elway has an estimated net worth of $145 million dollars</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-much-does-elway-make></span>How much does Elway make?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Elway earns a salary of&nbsp;$3 million per year.
