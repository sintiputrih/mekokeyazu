All dermal fillers are different, having been made using different manufacturing methods and with each filler being suitable for a different area of the face. A trained practitioner will be able to advise which filler is suitable for you.</p><p id=eHPHgHKvodTP data-wc=8><strong>Myth 2:</strong> Dermal fillers have lots of downtime</p><p id=enmDwzzcF-Pi data-wc=69><strong>Fact:</strong> Whilst dermal fillers have some downtime, most people report that any tell-tale signs and redness are back to normal within 48 hours. As a non-surgical procedure, they offer less downtime than other more invasive treatments. Some filler companies even offer skincare (like the TEOXANE Deep Repair Balm) to apply after treatment to reduce any redness to the area, allowing you to get back to your normal routine faster.</p><p id=eYLS0FGg9eVZ data-wc=8><strong>Myth 3: </strong>Dermal filler is a painful procedure</p><p id=e4JT2qNhuUuV data-wc=56><strong>Fact:</strong> Everyone has different pain tolerance levels, but many people who have dermal filler report a pain free experience. Most practitioners will use numbing cream which helps with the initial injection, and the majority of dermal fillers these days contain a local anaesthetic within them which makes the treatment far more comfortable than you might expect.</p><p id=eZSXL9ehQdwl data-wc=9><strong>Myth 4:</strong> Dermal fillers will make you look unnatural</p><p id=ebYZG6Ln2a4J data-wc=46><strong>Fact:</strong> There’s no need to look overfilled because dermal fillers have changed over time allowing for a more natural outcome. With the right product in the right place, and in the hands of an experience practitioner, there is no reason why your results shouldn’t look natural.</p><p id=eX3eTezzV6Ei data-wc=14><strong>Myth 5:</strong> Once I start, I will have to commit to having dermal filler</p><p id=e6Si7FjgrwjC data-wc=47><strong>Fact: </strong>Dermal fillers are a temporary aesthetic procedure. Whilst fillers generally need to be maintained every six to 24 months, there is no commitment to re-do the treatment at any stage and the product will gradually break down just as the natural hyaluronic in your body does.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3d390cc3e286-dermal-filler-teoxane-z.jpg><h2>What is TEOXANE filler?</h2><p id=eNYQW6BqDnsh data-wc=50>TEOXANE is a dermal filler manufacturer that has established a proven track record of next generation hyaluronic acid filler solutions. Dermal fillers have been specifically designed to treat a range of aesthetic concerns, including improving the appearance of wrinkles, adding or restoring volume to the face, and improving skin quality.</p><p id=e6umMMXHnLnB data-wc=54>The award-winning RHA range of dermal fillers, which have been voted <strong>Injectable Product of the Year at the Aesthetics Awards 2021</strong>, cleverly preserve facial expressions so that you’re not left with an unnatural or ‘frozen’ appearance. One product from this range is RHA Kiss which is specifically designed for subtle lip reshaping and volume.</p><p id=emtbhNeDuse1 data-wc=18>Another popular product is TEOXANE’s PURESENSE REDENSITY® 2, which is specifically designed to treat the delicate under-eye area.</p><h2>What are the benefits of TEOXANE filler?</h2><p id=es3jsqu7SleY data-wc=64>One of the benefits of TEOXANE’s RHA® range of dermal fillers is that they are designed to work with, not against, your natural facial expressions, making them ideal for creating an outstanding natural look. Using RHA technology (Resilient Hyaluronic Acid) means that the fillers offer natural-looking outcomes because they mimic the behaviour and characteristics of natural hyaluronic acid, which is found in our bodies.</p><p id=ex2Bsik1Z759 data-wc=38>TEOXANE’s RHA® range of dermal fillers are also known for their resilience. Unlike traditional hyaluronic acid dermal fillers, they can spring back to their original shape after being altered, stretched, bent, or compressed, with your natural facial movements.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/63d4e16d8b31-teoxane-z.jpg><h2>How long does TEOXANE filler last?</h2><p id=e_aoWH2fY3er data-wc=40>Hyaluronic acid dermal filler treatments can typically last between six to 24 months. However, this duration can vary per individual, and is based on several factors including your skin type, lifestyle and the volume of filler used in your treatment.</p><h2>What is the price of TEOXANE filler?</h2><p id=eaiSIRYLYjAy data-wc=24>The price of your TEOXANE filler will depend on which specific filler product is used, how much is used, and which practitioner you visit.</p><h2>How can I find a trusted practitioner?</h2><p id=eBAva-BZV5Ni data-wc=56>When it comes to any aesthetic treatment, research is key. Taking the time to research the practitioner, brand of dermal filler and the outcomes you should expect are a great first step when approaching dermal filler treatments. It’s also important to look for recommendations and previous reviews of both the practitioner and clinic you’re considering visiting.</p><p id=epFefxLzSP05 data-wc=47>If in doubt, you can contact certain filler brands such as TEOXANE to see which practitioners are registered near you. Ahead of finding a practitioner, you can also visit the <span><a aria-label=teoxane class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">TEOXANE Treatments platform</a></span>, a helpful assessment which will help you find which dermal filler could be right for you.</p><h6 style=text-align:center><span><a aria-label="teoxane treatments platform" class="product__button hm-link" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Visit TEOXANE Treatments platform</a></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaGlpamFmfnN%2BkGttbG1mZMGmu9eapZ5llJq%2Frq3LZp2ipJyav26ywJyrrGWZo7Owvsyaq6KnnmQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
