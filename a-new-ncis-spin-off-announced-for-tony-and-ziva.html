We also want to acknowledge and thank the fans from around the world who supported the ‚ÄòTiva‚Äô movement for years. To this day, they say hello in grocery stores and on the street to tell us how much these characters mean to them and ask what Tony and Ziva are up to now. This is for you!‚Äù the duo added.</p><p>This new chapter will tell stories from their point of view in a fresh new setting. Tony left NCIS to take care of their daughter after it appeared that Ziva had died. But NCIS fans later learned she had faked her death. The trio is now together in Europe, opening the door for new drama.</p><p>‚ÄúTiva is back!
