A Hulu show is now in the works with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott poised to team up with Legion and Fargo creator Noah Hawley</a>, and the second, third and fourth films are set to get a 4K remaster.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/158515416174369896-2020-06-18T134316.957.jpeg alt=Aliens width=1200 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=406 data-current-count=406 data-injectable=true>1979’s Alien is already available in Ultra HD, so it was only a matter of time before the rest of the franchise followed suit. However, the news comes with the caveat that the remastered versions will debut exclusively on Disney Plus’ STAR expansion, which has made vast swathes of the 20th Century Fox library available to subscribers outside of the United States, and only launched yesterday.</p><p data-characters=337 data-current-count=337 data-injectable=false>However, it would be safe to assume that they’ll also be added to Hulu eventually, while a home video Blu-Ray release is tentatively penciled in for some point next year. Completionists will be keen to get their hands on the entire 4K <strong>Alien</strong> box set as soon as it becomes available, but streaming will have to do for the time being.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomKWhlaPAbq3LopynZWNirq21xKdkq52jqr%2BzscKtoKimXWm4br7EppisrJWnfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
