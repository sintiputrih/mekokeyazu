They have been slowly trying to build up a presence in the US, but there has always been a bit of a delay between the launch in the North American market compared to the Asian one. TP-LINK has traditionally worked closely with Qualcomm Atheros, often being one of the first vendors to prepare solutions based on the QCA platforms.</p><p>At CES 2015, TP-LINK became one of the first vendors to launch a 4x4 MU-MIMO-capable 802.11ac router with the <a href=#>QCA9980 platform</a>. As of the end of last year, Quantenna was the only vendor with a shipping 4x4 MU-MIMO solution. However, this CES has seen the launch / customer shipment of 4x4 MU-MIMO 802.11ac solutions from Qualcomm Atheros, Broadcom and Marvell. We will have a separate piece comparing the various solutions. With reference to TP-LINK, the QCA9980 finds a place in the Archer AC2600. The unit also sports USB 3.0 ports, and other features are what is standard for a flagship model.</p><p>The <a href=#>Broadcom Xstream platform</a> does find a place in the Archer AC3200. With two 5 GHz radios and a single 2.4 GHz radio, this is the same platform that other vendors are already using (Netgear seems to have had an exclusive for a few months with the Nighthawk X6 R8000).</p><p>On the powerline side, TP-LINK is staying with Qualcomm Atheros for the AV1200 HomePlug AV2 with MIMO solution. The TL-PA8030 can deliver 1.2 Gbps of throughput theoretically and sports three gigabit ports. It can use all three prongs (power, ground and neutral) for data transmission.</p><p>The announced products are slated to appear in the market in Q3 2015.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIV5gJZoq6mkmaO4tHnNnquwp6Kgtq%2BzjKympa2knryvv4yaq2ablah6c3yQbg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
