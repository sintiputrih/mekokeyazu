When Malia moved to Los Angeles in 2021 to pursue a career in Hollywood, Sasha actually chose to transfer schools in order to be closer to her big sis.

"The thing I love the most is that those two girls are each other's best friends," she gushed, revealing, "There was a period of time when they couldn't stand each other, and I said, 'You wait ...&nbsp;you are gonna wake up one day and you're gonna look over at that other person and you're gonna know that you two share something very unique,' especially given what they've been through."&nbsp;</p><p>The former first lady also offered some insight into what life is like in Casa Obama. She recalled visiting Malia and Sasha with Barack Obama and being invited over for drinks before dinner. "We were like, 'OK, let's see what this is going to be like,'" she recalled, joking, "The martinis were a little weak." What really amused them, though, was the Obama sisters asking them to use coasters. "I'm like, 'You never used a coaster in my house!'" Michelle laughed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamthZoNwwMeipaCrXZm2pbrTZqKnp6diuqK4yJpkrJmjna5uu8GapJpn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
