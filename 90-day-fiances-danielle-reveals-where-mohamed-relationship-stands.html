I mean, he’s supportive of my schooling and I’m supportive of his job. I think what helps me to communicate with Mohammed is my dad used to be a truck driver and I talked to him about his trucking job.”</p><p>Fans first met the former couple on season 2 of <a href=#>90 Day Fiancé</a>, which aired 2014. At the time, Mohamed, who met Danielle online, moved from Tunisia to Ohio to try and make their relationship work.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/90-Day-Fiances-Danielle-Says-There-Are-No-Romantic-Feelings-With-Mohamed-001.jpg><p>The pair’s ups and downs, which played out on the series and its spinoff <a href=#>90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After?</a>, included a cheating scandal that involved Mohamed chatting online with other women. After initially seeking an annulment in October 2016, Danielle was granted a divorce in March 2017.</p><p>Following their split, the duo stopped speaking for three years. During a recent episode of <a href=#>90 Day: The Single Life</a>, however, fans saw Danielle and Mohamed catch up for the first time. Their conversation was both emotional and healing.</p><p>“That first conversation, I felt like I got some of the closure that I needed,” she told Us. “But then when we had the second conversation via zoom [and] I definitely got more of the closure that I needed, and I felt much better after the second conversation.”</p><p>Danielle noted that having their marriage be so public <a href=#>hurt their relationship</a>, which is why they’ve “kept people out of our friendship, and we keep everything between me and him.”</p><p>While fans didn’t get to see the pair makeup on camera, Danielle told Us that she does feel like she’s “gotten the apology” she deserved from her ex-husband … off camera. The TLC personality explained that although they had a rocky split, her friendship with Mohamed has brought her peace.</p><p>“I never thought that it would happen, but he’s [grown] over the years. He’s in his 30s now, you know, they say guys mature later,” she told Us. “So, I think he’s matured a lot over the years after being out on his own and having things happen to him and he’s realized that I was a good person and that I did a lot for him and took him that long to realize it.”</p><p>Danielle revealed that she feels like he “genuinely” wants to be close with her now that he doesn’t “need anything from me.”</p><p>The reality star added that <a href=#>her kids are “OK” with her friendship</a> with Mohamed, saying that her former spouse is “really fond” of her youngest child and is “always asking about her” when they speak.</p><p>When it comes to moving forward romantically, Danielle said she would be “OK” with Mohamed finding someone else.</p><p>“I mean he deserves to be happy too, but I think right now he’s just too busy with truck driving,” she explained, noting he knows about her relationship with new love interest, Robert, which has been playing out on <a href=#>90 Day: The Single Life</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>90 Day: The Single Life and The Single Life Pillow Talk are now streaming on Discovery+.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGZyaF2Zrrp5xaKYp5uVqHqlrc2inKWklWK%2FpsLEmqOsZaedsrOxjKamoZmdmrFuvsSlmK2hn6PAqbXPZqqtmZ6ZwHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
