Taking to Reddit, one fan wrote: &#34;I have a feeling she's being set up to get murdered horribly as a plot point,&#34; while another added: &#34;Same here, I like the character, but I have this nagging feeling."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Just ONCE I want to see a character in the NCIS universe have a happy and healthy romantic relationship. No more killing off people like Breena, Emily Fornell, LaSalle's whole family (and him), Gibbs's ex-wives, Jackie Vance, etc ... enough of that!"&nbsp;</p><p id=eqYCENPzi61- data-wc=66>However, others are predicting a different fate for Kate, with one writing: <strong>"How long till Whistler is forced out of the FBI and she then joins NCIS?" </strong>In reply, a viewer speculated: "I hope not, it's nice to see inter-agency cooperation actually working, whereas normally in&nbsp;&nbsp;(doesn't really matter which show you're watching) every outside agency is portrayed as somewhat hostile or obstructive towards NCIS."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c7953cb63988-whistler-6-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=enn0hpRHhuAS data-wc=4><strong>What do you think?</strong></p><p id=epi6MTcY5QYI data-wc=66>Kate is a much-loved character on the show, as is her relationship with her wife, Lucy, who has been absent from the last few episodes. Lucy told Kate that she&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>would be leaving</a>&nbsp;the island back in episode seven of the current series, explaining that she had been offered a new role as a Special Agent Afloat - a position she applied for when the pair were broken up.&nbsp;</p><p id=eWteHhY5Bc2t data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Is this the reason why Yasmine Al-Bustami left NCIS: Hawai'i halfway through season 2?</a></strong></p><p id=ecqQHNB0FPbN data-wc=1><strong>TRENDING:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Crosby Stills and Nash singer David Crosby dies at the age of 81</a></strong></p><p id=eCxZDSdibeMw data-wc=76>However, star of the drama&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Vanessa Lachey</a>, who plays Jane Tennant, reassured fans that Yasmine will be back at some point in the future.
