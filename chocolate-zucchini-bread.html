My Mom talked about the years she had a huge garden in our Scottsdale home. She would try so hard to get certain fruits and vegetables to grow but there was one “steady Eddie” in the bunch — the zucchini.&nbsp; It would grow so big and so fast that she had zucchini coming out of her ears!</p><p>She would get out her cookbooks, thumb through and find every single zucchini recipe known to man, and make it.&nbsp; This is where the sneaking in the veggies came from. She was the master at it! We had no idea what she had up her sleeve.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Chocolate-Zucchini-Bread-4.jpg alt="Chocolate Zucchini Bread.

Who knew? The zucchini not only brings a healthy factor, but it also helps to make it moist.&nbsp; Now that is a vegetable which deserves some accolades! They key is to FINELY shred the zucchini. When I use my box grater, I use the fine grater option. The zucchini magically disappears when it is baked.</p><p>This double chocolate bread is so moist because it has a combination of both butter and oil. It is the perfect marriage as the butter brings the rich flavor and the oil creates a moist texture.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Chocolate-Zucchini-Bread-2.jpg alt="Chocolate Zucchini Bread.

They both sweeten the bread but the addition of the molasses in the brown sugar creates a chewy texture.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Chocolate-Zucchini-Bread-Recipe-1.jpg alt="Chocolate Zucchini Bread.

It is what brings the extra dual layer chocolate flavor which makes it so rich and decadent.&nbsp; By folding the majority of the chocolate chips into the batter and then sprinkling the top of the bread with the remaining chocolate chips, you get creamy chocolate in every bite! I usually reach for semi-sweet chocolate chips but if you want a sweeter bread, use milk chocolate chips.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Chocolate-Zucchini-Bread-3c.jpg alt="Chocolate Zucchini Bread.

Since oven temperatures can vary, I would suggest checking the bread at the minimum time listed (40 minutes), and put a toothpick in to check for doneness.</p><p>So here’s to sneaking veggies into a decadent chocolate bread without our kids even noticing! This bread can be served with some sweet cream butter or even a spread of Nutella, chocolate hazelnut spread. Now, we are talking!</p><p><strong>FOLLOW ME ON:</strong><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong><span><strong><a href=#>INSTAGRAM</a></strong></span><strong>&nbsp;—&nbsp;</strong><span><strong><a href=#>FACEBOOK</a></strong></span><strong> —&nbsp;</strong><span><strong><a href=#>PINTEREST</a></strong></span></p><p><strong>Pin on Pinterest:</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Chocolate-Zucchini-Bread-Recipe.jpg alt="Chocolate Zucchini Bread.
