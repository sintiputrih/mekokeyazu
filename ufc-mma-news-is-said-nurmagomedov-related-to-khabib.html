In fact, fight fans may misidentify many of his teammates as them being related to him because of their similar looks. One such fighter is Said Nurmagomedov. Considering they have the same last name, many assume they may be brothers. Are they related, though?</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><b>All about Said Nurmagomdev</b></h2><p><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong>Said Nurmagomedov</strong></a> is a mixed martial artist born on April 5, 1990 Makhachkala, Dagestan, Russia. He made his MMA debut at the nascent age of 15 in 2009, facing a 4-0 record holder Oscar Nave and defeated him in the opening round with an armbar. He has since fought in various MMA promotions and eventually made his debut in Dana White’s promotion in 2018 and now competes in the bantamweight division of the UFC. He has a professional MMA record 17-2-0 and has 6 wins and 1 loss in his UFC tenure so far, with notable victories over fighters such as <strong>Ricardo Ramos</strong> and <strong>Mark Striegl</strong>.</p><p>Nurmagomedov is known for his aggressive fighting style, powerful striking, and high-level grappling skills, which he developed through years of training in sambo and wrestling. He made his UFC debut in 2018, and since then, he has been steadily climbing the ranks of the bantamweight division, with his sights set on becoming a UFC champion.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><b>Is said Nurmagomedov related to Khabib?</b></h2><p><strong>Said Nurmagomedov</strong>, <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>a rising prospect in the UFC</a>, is often confused with the famous undefeated UFC legend <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong>Khabib Nurmagomedov</strong></a>. Due to their identical surnames and shared Dagestani roots, many have speculated that the two fighters are related. The rumors gained momentum after Said signed with the UFC in early 2018, leading to a lot of speculation in the media. But Said Nurmagomedov and Khabib Nurmagomedov’s relationship doesn’t exceed beyond their native land Dagestan and coincidentally identical last names.</p><p>As <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>reported by Vimbuzz</a>, to address the rumors, both fighters have spoken publicly and made it clear that they are not related in any way. Khabib himself spoke about it in an interview, stating, “Of course, I know him. He’s a very good friend. He’s an amazing fighter. But he’s not my cousin even though we have the same name. He has a very big chance in the UFC.”</p><img id=img-tag-node--img-loader-0 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/Said-Nurmagomedov.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Said Nurmagomedov has also addressed the issue and said, “It happens frequently. Even in Abu Dhabi, I get that. Not Khabib specifically, but they think we’re all the same. But it doesn’t bother me, though”.</p><p>Therefore, it is clear that despite their shared surname and Dagestani heritage, UFC 135-pounder Said Nurmagomedov and Khabib Nurmagomedov are not related in any manner. Despite the confusion, Said has made a name for himself in the UFC with his impressive skills and has a promising career ahead of him.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><b></b><b>How many brothers does </b><b>Khabib Nurmagomedov </b><b>have?</b></h2><p><strong>Khabib Nurmagomedov</strong>, the former UFC lightweight champion, comes from a family of three siblings. He has an older brother named <strong>Magomed Nurmagomedov</strong>, who has some background in wrestling despite never competing professionally. Khabib also has a younger sister named <strong>Amina Nurmagomedov</strong>.</p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-ufc-mma-news-is-islam-makhachev-a-better-fighter-than-khabib-nurmagomedov?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/20200720091811/Islam-Makhachev-Khabib-Nurmagomedov-560x315.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">Is Islam Makhachev a Better Fighter Than Khabib Nurmagomedov?</p></a><p>None of Khabib’s siblings are related to the UFC or combat sports in general. The now-retired fighter prefers to keep his family out of the limelight.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><b>How have Khabib Nurmagomedov’s cousins fared in the UFC?</b></h2><p><strong>Khabib Nurmagomedov</strong> has siblings who are not involved in combat sports. However, he has three cousins who have carved a name for themselves in the fight world. <strong>Abubakar Nurmagomedov</strong>, Khabib’s eldest competing cousin, is a welterweight fighter with a professional MMA record of 17-3-1, and a UFC record of 2-1-0. Abubakar was at the center of the controversial brawl between Khabib and <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong>Conor McGregor</strong></a> after UFC 229, resulting in a year-long suspension by NSAC. In 2019, Abubakar made his UFC debut against <strong>David Zwada</strong> but lost the bout, marking his third and, so far, the last upset in his professional MMA career.</p><p>Similarly, <strong>Umar Nurmagomedov</strong>, like his cousin Khabib, is an undisputed fighter. He made his UFC debut in 2021 in the bantamweight division and has been on an impressive unbeaten run since then, with four wins to his name. Umar has shown no sign of weakness, much like his cousin, and is quickly making a name for himself in the UFC.</p><p>Usman Nurmagomedov, another of Khabib’s cousins, has been on an undefeated streak in professional MMA (16-0-0). He competes in the lightweight division in Bellator MMA since 2021 and has already won the Bellator lightweight championship from his last victory against <strong>Patricky Pitbull</strong> in November 2022.</p><p>Moreover, there are many fighters who are not related to Khabib Nurmagomedov by blood, but are still part of the ‘Team Khabib’ and are making a mark in the Octagon. And one of the most notable names is <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong>Islam Makhachev</strong></a>, who is often referred to as Khabib’s ‘little brother’, despite not being related to him in any way.</p><p><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Makhachev has proven himself to be a lethal fighter under Khabib’s coaching</a> with his grappling skills, and his record speaks for itself. He is currently on an 8-fight win streak and is considered a top contender in the lightweight division.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/Said-Nurmagomedov.jpg><p>In addition to Makhachev, there are several other fighters who are part of ‘Team Khabib’ and are making waves in the UFC.
