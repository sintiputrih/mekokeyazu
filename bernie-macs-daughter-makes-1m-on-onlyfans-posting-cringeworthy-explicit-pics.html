Your daughter,’” Denise said on the February 8 episode of The Viall Files, via <a href=# rel=noopener>E! News</a>. “I didn’t collaborate with my daughter.”</p><p>“Did I do a picture with my daughter’s faces and I that was on social media? Yes. Did I collaborate with my daughter for like a sexual OnlyFans shoot? Abso-f*cking-lutely not,” she clarified. “That is not true. I haven’t even been on my daughter’s site. I was protecting her as a young woman coming into this industry, being judged.”</p><p>Denise shares daughter Sami, and younger daughter <strong>Lola Sheen</strong>, 18, with ex-husband <strong>Charlie Sheen</strong>, 58. She also has a third daughter, Eloise, 12, who she’s raising with husband <strong>Aaron Phypers</strong>, 51.</p><p>Continuing on about the backlash she received for her since-deleted post about her and Sami’s potential OnlyFans collab, which included fans slamming the idea as “gross” and “disgusting,” Denise said, “It’s not fair.”</p><p>“Whether people agree or not, and it’s easy to judge—how can I judge stuff with some of the things I’ve done in my career?” she wondered. “Like when I was in Wild Things and I did Playboy, did I ever think, ‘Oh gosh, one day when my kids are older…’ You don’t think about that stuff because it seems so far away. Well, then that day comes and you’re like, ‘Well sh*t—I have to deal with this.’ It’s hard.”</p><p>As RHOBH fans may recall, Denise joined OnlyFans in June 2022 to show support for Sami, who joined a short time prior.</p><p>Moving on to Lisa, Denise <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a> they’re no longer friends “because she’s an a**hole.”</p><p>“It’s really sad. I was friends with her for 20 years. I think she got caught up with being on the show, and I think she was not, at some point, the person I knew,” she explained.</p><p>Looking back on their cast trip to Rome, Denise said that while they seemed to be turning over a new leaf, Lisa seemed to have ultimately had a change of heart.</p><p>“She apologized and then we went to the Vatican and all this, and she was like, ‘Thank you so much.’ And then we get back from Rome, and she flipped again,” Denise revealed.</p><p>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills season 13 airs Wednesdays at 8/7c on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOm5yrppmaeq6twqxknZmlnLW1sdFmpJqjlah6crmMqKVmp56hxqetzaxkqaejqbavs4ycqaKml5rEsL7TobBmnailuaqvyK1kqaGTqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
