Searchlight Pictures has already halted production due to the actor’s conduct on-site. The 71-year-old said that he “did something” that he thought was hilarious, but “it wasn’t taken that way.” Last week, the producers decided to halt work while they investigated the incident.&nbsp;Being Mortal was said to have completed over half of its main filming, with a release date of 2023 projected. However, it remains unknown if the film will restart production with Murray’s participation.</p><h2>What does Bill Murray have to say about the claims of sexual misconduct?</h2><p>Deadline reported at the end of the second week of April that the Ghostbusters actor had reportedly acted improperly on the set of Being Mortal, prompting Searchlight Pictures to initiate an inquiry.&nbsp;Murray later told CNBC that there was a “conflict of opinion” with a lady on the set. It is yet unknown if the lady was an actor or a crew member. Becky Quick of CNBC spoke with the actor, who stated:</p><p>“I did something I felt was hilarious, but it wasn’t received as such.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Bill-Murray-2.jpg alt="Bill Murray" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Bill Murray also hinted at being in communication with the individual, claiming that the two parties involved are attempting to “make peace with one other.” Murray’s comments suggested that the lady was a co-star. He stated:</p><p>“We’re both professionals, we enjoy each other’s work, and we like each other, so there’s no sense in working together or creating the movie if we can’t get along and trust one other. It’s been a great learning experience for me.”</p><p></p><p>The actor, on the other hand, was hopeful that they would be able to put the event behind them once filming resumed. Bill Murray went on to explain how he utilized his experience to learn from his blunders. Murray did, however, state that he would only begin his peace offering if the lady involved in the incident agreed.</p><h2>Bill Murray has previously been accused of improper conduct.</h2><p>Last year, Elementary actress Lucy Liu discussed her contentious experience on the set of Charlie’s Angels (2000), which included Murray. Murray yelled at Liu, according to the Los Angeles Times, over a scene revision that he had missed.</p><p>While Liu did not go into specifics, she did say:</p><p>“Some of the profanity was heinous and unforgivable…”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Bill-Murray-3.jpg alt="Bill Murray" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>While no more complaints against Murray have emerged, it remains to be seen how the actor’s prior troubles will effect his ability to be cast in future Hollywood movies.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZoqScYrq2vtGasGavkah6oq%2FCrqqenF2ks265yKyaqKaUqrC1ec6nZK2glWLApsCMqJ1moJmoera8wqikoqaXYrOquMxo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
