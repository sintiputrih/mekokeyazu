"It's a beautiful balance of masculine and feminine."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even while at home throughout the pandemic, wearing a scent was a staple in her morning routine. "Fragrance is so importance to me in general, not only in terms of my perfumes, but everything, even the way my house smells and the products I put on my face," she says. "I am very sensitive to scents, which are connected to memories. Like when someone smells your sweater when you're not around — it is just a super personal thing."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ahead, Kravitz opens up about the biggest lesson she's learned over the last year about her mental health, beauty advice passed down from parents Lenny Kravitz and Lisa Bonet, and the inspiration behind her ever-evolving tattoo collection.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>InStyle</strong>: <strong>Has your routine changed a lot in the past year?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Zoë Kravitz:</strong> I am still figuring out how to wear clothes again. [laughs] During the pandemic, I definitely took a bit more time to mask, steam, and ice my face. Little things like that to get my skin feeling healthy, because I wasn't able to get facials, but I was still working and wearing a lot of makeup. I remembered how much I love getting ready to go out — doing your makeup, listening to music, drinking a glass of wine — and it was kind of taken away from us. It's been fun being able to get back into the world and enjoy that process again. It's such a sweet, personal time, and it's important that we take those moments to love on ourselves.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Zoe Kravitz</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Did you still wear fragrance while at home?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I did — not every day, but I just put it on without even thinking in the morning since it's part of my routine and makes me feel like myself. Fragrance is so important to me in general, not only in terms of my perfumes, but even in the way my house smells and the products I put on my face. I am very sensitive to scents, which are connected to memories. Like when someone smells your sweater when you're not around, it is just a super personal thing. YSL's Black Opium is absolutely one of my favorites. I love that it's not too sweet or too musky with the jasmine and the coffee notes. It's a beautiful balance of masculine and feminine.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Zoë Kravitz</h3><p>I think life is like a game of dress-up in a lot of ways.</p><p>— Zoë Kravitz</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What were some of the things you learned about yourself during the pandemic?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I realized how much my mental health is affected by not being able to do little things that make me feel good. Some things become routine; we put makeup on because we're supposed to. But doing that can boost your confidence and make you feel like a different person. You get to access and highlight different parts of your personality based on how you're dressing and what your makeup is like. I think life is really a game of dress-up in a lot of ways. Fashion and beauty are self-expression. It should be playful and fun.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What are some of the beauty lessons your parents [Lisa Bonet and Lenny Kravitz] have shared with you over the years?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It has always been about health, using organic products, eating well, exercising, drinking lots of water, and getting enough sleep. When you feel good and your body is happy, healthy, and balanced, your skin looks good. When we're not feeling good, our skin is dehydrated and we start breaking out; then we tend to use makeup to cover ourselves up more and hide. I believe that beauty starts with what's on the inside and how we take care of ourselves.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>I read that you might be totaling 56 tattoos. Do you view your ink collection as an extended expression of beauty?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I think tattoos are a beautiful form of adornment, just like makeup or jewelry. It's funny because I don't even know how many I have. [laughs] I hardly see them anymore because I am so used to them. There are some I like more than others. I have gotten a few removed, but I plan on getting more tattoos. Once you're into it, it's hard to stop.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-zos-must-haves></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Zoë's Must-Haves</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Retrouvé Revitalizing Eye Concentrate</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Retrouv</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">$415/30 ml; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>retrouve.com</a>.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Biologique Recherche Lotion P50</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Biologique Recherche</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">biologique-recherche.com</a>.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>YSL Beauty Black Opium Eau de Parfum Extreme</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy YSL Beauty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">$130/ 90 ml; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">yslbeautyus.com</a>.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Kopari Coconut Cleansing Oil</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Kopari</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">$32; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">koparibeauty.com</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For more stories like this, pick up the September 2021 issue of InStyle, available on newsstands, on Amazon, and for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>digital download</a> Aug. 13th.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMewsYykqZqumanHbq7EmqytsV2eu7Wx0a%2Bgnq9dZ31zfQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
