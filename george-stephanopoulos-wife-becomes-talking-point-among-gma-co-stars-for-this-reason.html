In the film, Ali has a scene-stealing moment as she slices bananas on to an open grave, and the GMA anchors couldn't help but fall apart laughing as Jerry shared just how "hysterical" Ali is in the movie.&nbsp;</p><p id=e2VDhwnR2f data-wc=61>"Ali has the biggest laugh in the movie, because we have a scene where someone loses their life in a tragic pop tart accident, and because of the heroism he was buried with full cereal honors – which means we put milk and cereal in the grave – and Ali comes up and slices bananas," laughed Jerry.
