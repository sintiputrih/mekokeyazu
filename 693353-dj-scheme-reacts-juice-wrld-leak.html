The song was reportedly meant to be the lead single from Juice's next posthumous album The Party Never Ends. Now Juice's friend and frequent collaborator DJ Scheme has taken to Twitter to give his thoughts on the leak. "Biscotti leaked I guess how is it guys," his first tweet says. While he seemed disappointed to learn that the song was out at first, he changed his tune with later tweets.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I never seen anyones fans really go crazy for leaks like Juices.. Its such a beautiful thing bc I know the love for these songs come from ur hearts ðŸ–¤ LLJW," he said in a follow-up tweet. "Thank you guys for keeping him alive things like This bring me back to when we were all together." Juice WRLD's notoriously prolific recording style left hundreds of songs in the vault after his tragic death. Much like other artists who record a lot of material like Playboi Carti and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Uzi Vert</a>, Juice has been susceptible to leaks often.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-dj-scheme-speaks-on-juice-wrld-leaks>DJ Scheme Speaks On Juice WRLD Leaks</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Even though it's been more than three years since Juice Wrld's death he continues to have more material released. When <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Young Thug</a> released a special "Metro's Version" of his new album Business Is Business, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Juice Wrld was included</a>. The track Money saw Juice teaming up with both Young Thug and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Nicki Minaj</a>. He's also featured on a new song that serves as the lead single from an upcoming Lyrical Lemonade album.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"Doomsday" sees Juice Wrld teaming up with Cordae</a> over an <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Eminem</a> instrumental. The song was reportedly recorded over 4 years ago but was just released last week. It's the second new track from Juice to drop this year. Back in March, he released another new track called "The Light." His upcoming album The Party Never Ends doesn't yet have an official release date planned.
