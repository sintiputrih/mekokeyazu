Fans were overjoyed when both <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Olivia Colman</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Emilia Clarke</a> were added to the Marvel universe, hoping for big things from both of them. While theories might’ve been way off — Clarke didn’t turn out to be Abigail Brand, for instance — thankfully the Secret Invasion finale leaves the door open for more from both of them.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=477 data-current-count=477 data-injectable=true>As both characters — SIS chief Sonya Falsworth and Talos’ daughter G’iah — are original creations for the screen, there’s really no roadmap that we can look to when guessing how these two could return in the MCU. But, knowing what we do about the future of the franchise, as well as pulling some relevant concepts from the comics, here’s some spitballed suggestions for how Clarke and Colman could factor into the ever-growing multiverse of Marvel.</p><h2 id=h-the-marvels data-injectable=false>The Marvels</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/brie-larson-carol-danvers-iman-vellani-kamala-khan-the-marvels-1.jpg><p data-characters=566 data-current-count=866 data-injectable=true>With Secret Invasion clearly sliding into The Marvels in various ways, naturally we’re wondering if some of the characters from the recent series could show up in the Brie Larson sequel. And G’iah is clearly right at the top of the list, given that she now has an exact copy of Carol Danvers’ abilities. We’re desperate to see these two battle it out, so we can finally ascertain if G’iah really has dethroned Captain Marvel as the MCU’s new most OP character, although intel <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">suggests we probably shouldn’t hold our breath</a>.</p><h2 id=h-armor-wars data-injectable=false>Armor Wars</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Armor-Wars.jpg><p data-characters=616 data-current-count=916 data-injectable=true>A role for Emilia Clarke and/or Olivia Colman in The Marvels does seem a tad far-fetched unfortunately, as we’ve not heard a peep about such a crossover, but if it does fail to happen then there’s always Armor Wars. Although Sonya and G’iah didn’t interact with the real Rhodey in Secret Invasion, if you think about it, the amnesiac Avenger could form a bond with G’iah as their lives have both been impacted by the Skrull invasion. Plus, Stark technology falling into the wrong hands and causing a threat to the world is just the kind of thing that would fall on Sonya’s radar.</p><h2 id=h-black-knight data-injectable=false>Black Knight</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Kit-Harrington-the-Black-Knight-Eternals.jpg><p data-characters=454 data-current-count=754 data-injectable=true>You gotta feel sorry for Kit Harington and Dan Whitman, a character who looked set to take the MCU by storm but is now threatening to go the way of the Dodo. In an ideal world, though, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">despite his Blade cameo not panning out</a>, Black Knight would get his own solo project somewhere, preferably a Disney Plus series. If that ever does happen then we could easily see him being recruited by Sonya and perhaps forming an unlikely double act with G’iah.</p><h2 id=h-fantastic-four data-injectable=false>Fantastic Four</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fantastic-four-2005.jpg><p data-characters=546 data-current-count=846 data-injectable=true>There’s one school of thought about Emilia Clarke’s MCU future that suggests <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she’s about to become a villain</a>. Well, this would be in keeping with the original Super-Skrull from the comics, one of the most dangerous foes of the Fantastic Four. So could G’iah return as an antagonist in the Fantastic Four reboot or perhaps a sequel? It’s harder to see how Sonya would fit in alongside her, but maybe Colman could drop by for a cameo to explain to the foursome how G’iah broke bad and now they need to stop her.</p><h2 id=h-a-force data-injectable=false>A-Force</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/avengers-endgame.jpg><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=737 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">As I’ve previously argued</a>, G’iah getting souped-up on the Avengers’ powers makes her a primary candidate for A-Force membership, whenever Kevin Feige finally decides to make the all-female Avengers team a thing in the MCU. Likewise, given that the predominantly male OG Avengers line-up was assembled by Nick Fury, it only makes sense that A-Force should have their own female Fury-like figure. Enter Sonya Falsworth.</p><h2 id=h-excalibur data-injectable=false>Excalibur</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Excalibur_Vol_4_1_Textless.jpg><p data-characters=534 data-current-count=834 data-injectable=true>The curious thing about G’iah’s Secret Invasion transformation is that she’s actually <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">aping an iconic member of the X-Men</a>. Well, if that’s Marvel’s game then maybe she should go ahead and become a founding member of Excalibur. Marvel’s primary British superhero team, Captain Britain’s crew is often bolstered by numerous mutant characters. As mutants are still working their way into the MCU, G’iah would make for the perfect candidate for admission into a pre-X-Men Excalibur lineup.</p><h2 id=h-mi-13 data-injectable=false>MI-13</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Captain_Britain_and_mI-13-1.jpg><p data-characters=577 data-current-count=877 data-injectable=true>Alternatively, if Marvel wants to save Excalibur for when the X-Men are around, there’s always MI-13. The British government’s spy network tasked with investigating extranormal phenomena, MI-13 is basically the U.K.’s answer to The X-Files and is crying out to be made into a Disney Plus series. As a super-powered spy, G’iah would be right at home in their ranks and Sonya Falsworth would be a natural pick to be the team’s taskmaster. Plus, Black Knight and Blade are on their roster in the comics, so the crossovers are staring us in the face.</p><h2 id=h-captain-britain data-injectable=false>Captain Britain</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Captain-Britain.jpg><p data-characters=632 data-current-count=932 data-injectable=false>Despite folks fan-casting <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Henry Cavill as the character for years</a>, Marvel seems to have no interest in bringing Brian Braddock to life in the MCU. So here’s a left-field idea; what if G’iah becomes Earth-616’s answer to Captain Britain herself? Betsy Braddock, Brian’s sister who’s better known to X-Men fans as Psylocke, has become a female Captain in the comics, so the precedent has already been set. All I’m saying is, it’s about time the U.K. had its own hero in the MCU — Captain Carter doesn’t quite count — and G’iah could easily rise up as the surprise chosen one.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3x5edaasKxln6G2t7XAZpqopJ2Wu26tzZ1knqWZobaiecKlmKujlWKworqMq5ytraKjerW7jK2fnmWdmMJurcWtnKtlo5qws7HTZqCnrpGotrC6jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
