Many people were still sad that Punk was gone from Tony Khan’s company.</p><p>While speaking on <a href=#>WFAA</a>, Chris Jericho was asked about the backstage reaction in AEW to The Second City Saint’s WWE return after almost a decade. Jericho stated that it was just business as usual, so they weren’t exactly shocked or had a big reaction.</p><p>“It’s business as usual. It happens. It’s the same reason why I’m sure there wasn’t a big reaction when Adam Copeland came to AEW or when Will Ospreay signed with AEW or when Danielson, Moxley, and Adam Cole came to AEW. It’s good for the business that guys have the ability to go between companies. It’s great for the fans and it’s great for the talent overall. It just makes the business stronger and that’s the most important thing.”</p><p>Even AEW President&nbsp;<a href=#>Tony Khan has broken his silence regarding CM Punk’s WWE return</a>&nbsp;at the Survivor Series Premium Live Event. CM Punk also has crucial role in <a href=#>opening the door for talks between WWE and Warner Bros. Discovery</a>. We’ll have to see how Punk will continue to be booked in the coming weeks.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What do you think of what Chris Jericho had to say about AEW’s backstage reaction to CM Punk’s WWE return?
