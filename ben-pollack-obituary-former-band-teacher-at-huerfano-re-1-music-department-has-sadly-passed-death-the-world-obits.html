Nothing is known at this time about the circumstances of his unexpected death. Yesterday, Jacob Teal broke the news of Ben Pollack’s unexpected and abrupt death, conveying his deepest condolences.</p><p>The details surrounding his passing are still unknown, which has shocked and saddened his loved ones and the community. We will always remember Mr. Pollack as the remarkable band teacher who brought new life to the JMHS band program. His students made remarkable progress, demonstrating his passion and commitment to music education. The band, which he led, showcased its skill and dedication in marching band contests, parades, and solo contests.</p><p>Beyond his involvement in band activities, Mr. Pollack served as a mentor to students in the choir, helping them to achieve great success in a variety of competitions. Even more, he laboriously planned a trip to San Diego, California, to give students a chance to perform their musical talents. In spite of obstacles, the students were able to participate because of his tenacity and the energy they brought to the cause of raising money for a charter bus.</p><p>Everyone in the music department, from his students and colleagues to the community at large, feels a hole in their hearts with Mr. Pollack’s passing. Our deepest sympathies go out to Mr. Pollack’s loved ones and to all the students whose lives he touched through his tireless advocacy for music education. His impact as a motivating music educator is something that those fortunate enough to have known him will always remember and treasure.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiao5x7prDUZ62nZ5Kau268zqWjmpubYryjtdOumKuxXZu8s7nEq2SbmZ6ZerWxwJyfnqpdlsFutNSeqZ%2BZnqR6s7GMamSmraOesG6wxKmYq6ydmru1eceaqmarkZm5unnPmqqsnZRisaat06FkraCVYsSwvsudZKiamanAcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
