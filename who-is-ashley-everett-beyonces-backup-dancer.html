Recommended Videos Beyonce’s shows are known for their epic dance performances and routines, and only the best of the best make it to the stage alongside her, so why would anyone want to flee the Beyhive? Everett seems to be doing just that, so we had to get the scoop on this mysterious backup dancer and her story."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Everett seems to be doing just that, so we had to get the scoop on this mysterious backup dancer and her story.</p><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=526 data-injectable=true>Everett is not just one of Beyonce’s backup dancers, she is THE backup dancer. She is the lead backup dancer and captain of Beyonce’s dance team, which is why she calls herself “Captain to Beyonce.”</p><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=397 data-injectable=false>Lately, she has been generating rumors she is leaving this dream role in pursuit of something else, which is not only a shock for obvious reasons, but also because she got her start through Beyonce at the tender age of 17. She was attending Julliard at the time, but after a chance encounter she got the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to audition for the singer’s dance team, and she got it.</p><p data-characters=543 data-current-count=940 data-injectable=true>She dropped out of school and began dancing with Bey full-time. Within two years she was promoted to dance captain, at just 19. Yet she relished the role, and let’s be honest, rocked it. She stands front and just slightly left or right of center for practically every show, and she is always Beyonce’s right(or left) hand woman. She’s also been featured in several of the successful singer’s music videos such as “Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It),” and was right next to her for her Super Bowl Performance.</p><h2 id=h-is-ashley-everett-still-beyonce-s-backup-dancer data-injectable=false>Is Ashley Everett still Beyonce’s backup dancer?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ashley Everett (@ashleycmeverett)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=545 data-current-count=845 data-injectable=true>Lately, though, Everett’s name has been drawing a lot of attention, not for what she’s doing, but for what she’s not doing. She was reportedly absent from the first few performances of Beyonce’s Renaissance tour. The tour is one of her biggest yet, with the <a href=#>first few shows already packed</a>, and the entire run of gigs is estimated to bring in around $2 billion for the star, which is a good thing as Beyonce and Jay just bought quite literally <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the most expensive in California</a> and the second most expensive in the country.</p><p data-characters=582 data-current-count=582 data-injectable=true>Rumors have flown speculating everything from Everett quitting to being fired. A TikTok video of Everett’s caused quite the controversy, as many fans felt it indicated she would not be joining the Reinassance tour. The video featured her getting ready for a commercial, when fans felt she should have been getting ready for the tour. The comments flowed, but Everett simply laughed them off, yet the dance captain remains cryptic about her appearance. In an interview with <a href=#>Ebony,</a>, she replied “You’ll just have to stay tuned.” Well, that’s helpful.</p><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=404 data-injectable=true>Her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">social media</a> still hails her as “Dancer and Captain to Beyonce,” and no official announcement has been made yet, so until further notice, we guess the answer to the question of who is Ashley Everett remains the same. She is Beyonce’s lead dancer and dance captain. If something changes, she will be the former lead dancer and dance captain, as she pursues new career opportunities.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What else is Ashley Everett known for?</h2><p data-characters=462 data-current-count=462 data-injectable=true>Clearly, this dance captain’s claim to fame is being one of Beyonce’s most recognized and loved backups, yet the question remains as to who she was before the glitz and glamour. The talented dancer grew up in Chico, California, where she reportedly struggled to fit in as a mixed-race child, but it seemed to make her only more determined to find her place in the world as she moved to New York at 16 to attend the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre.</p><p data-characters=238 data-current-count=238 data-injectable=false>The rest, as they say, is history. She has been dancing for Beyonce ever since, as well as working with Usher, Jennifer Lopez, Sean Paul, and Tina Turner. Her dance resume is certainly very impressive, but it’s not her only talent.</p><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=532 data-injectable=true>She also hails herself as an actor, model, entrepreneur, and creator. She is the co-owner of Cachet Brands with Jay Burton. The brand sells CBD-infused products such as gummies and recovery sticks, all for the sake of “natural feel good,” which is the company’s catchphrase.</p><p data-characters=428 data-current-count=428 data-injectable=true>As far as her personal life goes, it was remarkably quiet until a viral proposal took fans by surprise and brought her love life right into the spotlight. Her boyfriend and fellow dancer of the time, John Silver, took Beyonce’s advice to heart, and in the middle of a “Single Ladies” rendition he casually took the microphone from Beyonce and proposed to Everett on stage. He quite literally put a ring on it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=440 data-current-count=740 data-injectable=true>Yet years later, Everett is still single, explaining in an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Elle</a> that she and Silver met when she was just 21 years old, and the six years they spent as a couple was mainly apart due to their hectic dance and tour schedules. Finally, she realized it was not the relationship for her and that the two just “weren’t on the same page” anymore, so she remains single and ready to mingle as far as anyone knows.</p><p data-characters=528 data-current-count=528 data-injectable=false>Ashley Everett, Beyonce’s captain, the Queen Bey’s right-hand lady, co-owner of Cachet; she’s known by many names, and as many things. Yet by far her biggest claim to fame and the role in her life that currently has the most attention is the one she currently holds. Not only does it have a lot of eyes on it, but it also carries a major question mark. Will the young California native continue to be second in command to Bey’s dancer bees? Or will she turn in her keys to the hive? Only time will tell.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9ahpmaho2KutLTLnrBmnaaav6bA02aZnrGfo7Cmv4ybmJyjpaV6pa3NnJyrZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
