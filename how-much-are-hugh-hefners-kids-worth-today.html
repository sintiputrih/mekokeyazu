It sold like hotcakes.</p><p>He also established Playboy Clubs and lived in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">infamous Playboy Mansion</a>, packed to the rafters with beautiful young women. He was a walking, partying brand ambassador who advocated "sexual liberation".</p><p>He had four kids. With his first wife Mildred, he had Christie (born 1952) and David (born 1955). He and Mildred split in 1959 and Hugh went about his partying, womanizing ways.</p><p>Then in 1989, he married Kimberley Conrad who was 36 years younger than he was and Playmate of the Year. They had two kids, Marston born in 1990, and Cooper Hefner born in 1991.</p><p>When Hef died in 2017, he left behind a fortune estimated at around by celebritynetworth.com at&nbsp;$50 million. His (very) young widow Crystal ended up getting a chunk of change and the rest was divided between Hugh's four kids, a university, and some charities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Let's have a look and see what Christie, David, Cooper, and Marston Hefner are worth.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">14 Facts About Marilyn Monroe That Have Recently Come To Light</a></span></p><h2 id=christie-hefner---net-worth-30-million>Christie Hefner - Net Worth $30 Million</h2><p>According to&nbsp;celebritynetworth.com Christie Hefner is worth a cool $30 million. Of course, she inherited money from her dad Hugh, but he also had a substantial career as Chairman of the Board and CEO of Playboy Enterprises from 1988 through 2009, when she retired.</p><p>Sensing a need to diversify, she oversaw the overseas expansion of the brand and the setting up of a TV network. And, realizing the future was online, in 1994 she set up&nbsp;Playboy.com.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">An Inside Look At Hugh Hefner's Legacy . . . His Children Emulate It</a></span></p><p>She was no slouch in the boardroom and for three years made it onto Fortune's list of the Most Powerful Women.</p><p>And these days? She's divorced and living in Chicago, focusing on doing good works for charities and the like.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=david-hefner---net-worth-500-000>David Hefner - Net Worth $500,000</h2><p>Now don't get up in arms. That net worth figure is simply what David has managed to make doing computer consulting and a bit of film work. What he inherited from his father is a bit of a mystery.</p><p>Spot the boring businessman picture? That's David all over.</p><p>Hef's will was weird. Not only did he leave out his then-wife Crystal, but he also put a clause in saying if any of his heirs <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">abused alcohol or drugs</a>, they wouldn't receive any money.&nbsp; We're not saying David has been into substance abuse, but we are saying that because of some of the weird clauses in the will, it can be hard to determine just how much Hef's heirs got.</p><p>Don't shed a tear for poor Crystal. She ended up getting around $7 million because she was married to him when he died.</p><p>David, who was born in 1955, is the least known of all the Hefner children. He wants nothing to do with the Playboy thing, intentionally shunning the spotlight. He keeps his net worth to himself, apparently.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=marston-hefner---net-worth-1-6-million>Marston Hefner - Net Worth $1.6 Million (?)</h2><p>OK, we are now into Hugh's second marriage to Kimberley Conrad. By the time Marston was born in 1990, Hugh and his family were living in the Playboy Mansion in California. Imagine growing up in that place! He's stayed out of the spotlight or tried to.</p><p>Like father, like son. A while back, 20-something Marston hooked up with Playmate Claire Sinclair. It did not end well. Marston reportedly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">went in for a bit of domestic violence</a>, punching Claire. Yes, he ended up getting arrested for domestic violence, forked out $20,000 in bail, and was ordered to do a domestic violence course.</p><p>Let's put it this way: His siblings don't go out of their way to hang out with the guy. And there's a big question mark over how much he is actually worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cooper-hefner---net-worth-5---10-million>Cooper Hefner - Net Worth $5 - $10 Million</h2><p>If Marston Hefner is the "black sheep" of the Hefner family, 30-year old Cooper Hefner is a sterling example of decency, hard work, and entrepreneurship. He worked for Playboy Enterprises while he was still in college, eventually working his way up to become the chief creative officer and chief of global partnerships. He's also done a couple of start-ups. And he's done his bit for his country, serving as a reservist in the U.S. Air Force. See? All around great guy.</p><p>And a couple of years back, he married Scarlett Byrne, the English actress who played Pansy Parkinson in the&nbsp;Harry Potter. Pansy was in Slytherin and not the warm and friendly type. Scarlett, by all accounts, is a sweetheart. They have one daughter who was born in 2020.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harry Potter Cast: Current Ages, Relationship Statuses, & Net Worths</a></span></p><p>And if all that wasn't enough, Cooper teaches at California's Chapman College and has announced he will be running for the California Senate in 2022.</p><p>He clearly sees a future for himself in politics. Is the world ready for President Hefner?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, that's what we know about Hugh Hefner's kids and their net worth. Of the four, clearly, Christie and Cooper have achieved the most in life. David has done okay. And we can just forget about Marston.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Crystal Hefner Struggles To Find Her Identity After Hugh Hefner's Death</a></span>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIyaqZ5lmKq0qXnHnp2nnaKoeqy1w6xksKeiqbVuwM6dmLJn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
