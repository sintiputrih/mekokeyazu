But recently, Cara Delevingne has been giving her a run for her money.

The model was previously accused of mocking Fox, too. Then recently, Banks has expressed her support for Delevingne amid the BBMAs controversy. Here's what's really going on between them.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Cara Delevingne Blames Her Break Up With Ashley Benson On The Pandemic</a></span></p><h2 id=cara-delevingne-mocked-julia-fox-39-s-viral-39-uncut-gems-39-video>Cara Delevingne Mocked Julia Fox's Viral 'Uncut Gems' Video</h2><p>Like everyone else after Fox's viral Uncut Gems clip, Delevingne joined in on the TikTok trend — lip-syncing the actress' weird pronunciation of the film and putting her own spin on it. However, fans weren't happy about the supermodel's parody. "She shouldn't be getting this brave cause at least Julia can act," said a Twitter user.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another fan also roasted Delevingne's heavily criticized movie, Suicide Squad. "Just saw a video of [Cara Delevingne] mocking [Julia Fox] which is funny because [Julia Fox] is in the cult class [Uncut Gems] and [Cara] has the [Suicide Squad]," they tweeted.</p><p>A netizen even brought up Delevingne's participation in the controversial Imagine video. "@Caradelevingne being part of the imagine video but trying to mock Julia Fox like TAKE EVERY SEAT MISS MAM WE DIDNT FORGET," tweeted the fan. In 2020, <a href=#>the supermodel, along with other celebrities like Gal Gadot filmed themselves singing John Lennon's Imagine</a> while self-isolating. <a href=#>The Wonder Woman actress</a> said she did it because she "feeling a bit philosophical" six days into quarantine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Every celebrity in that video was criticized for "trying to be relatable" when a lot of people were struggling during the lockdown. "Imagine being worth $10M+ and thinking singing a song with multiple other rich celebs will make people struggling to get by during a global pandemic feel better. @GalGadot @MarkRuffalo @Caradelevingne @jimmyfallon," wrote a fan.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>All The Ways Julia Fox's Life Has Changed Since Dating Kanye West</a></span></p><h2 id=julia-fox-called-cara-delevingne-39-thirsty-39>Julia Fox Called Cara Delevingne 'Thirsty'</h2><p>In 2021, Fox and her friend, Niki Takesh recalled an incident where Delevingne made a surprise appearance at an Azealia Banks concert. "The craziest thing happened," Takesh shared on Forbidden Fruits podcast. "We're watching Azealia Banks and, like, we look to the side of the stage, we were, like, up close in the front. And we see this person, like, trying to keep push past, rushing past security. Fox also remembered seeing Delevingne move to the front of the stage so Banks would notice her. "We realized very quickly that Cara is wasted," said the actress, adding that the model "fell backward" on the stage then fell into the crowd.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It was so crazy. I could tell by Azealia's face, she was like over it. She was like, 'OK, let me have my moment,'" Fox said of that time. She then labeled Delevingne's behavior as "thirsty." Recently, fans have realized that the actress's statement was actually a warning after seeing the model "thirst" on Megan Thee Stallion at the 2022 BBMAs. "Honestly should have listened when Julia Fox tried to warn everyone about Cara Delevingne," tweeted a fan. Another one added: "[Cara Delevingne] just confirmed [Julia Fox's] accusations on calling her weird."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then there are fans who actually think Fox and Delevingne should pair up and do crazy things together. "Cara Delevingne and Julia Fox should hang out I think they'd get along," one tweeted. Another fan also think that they should star in a reality show together. "Hear me out on this…[Cara Delevingne] and [Julia Fox] pair up for a reality show where they just attempt to attend normal functions," suggested the netizen, adding that "it truly would be the most iconic reality duo since <a href=#>[Paris Hilton] and [Nicole Richie]</a>."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>All The Men And Women Cara Delevingne Has Been Linked To, In Chronological Order</a></span></p><h2 id=azealia-banks-commented-on-cara-delevingne-39-s-bbmas-behavior>Azealia Banks Commented On Cara Delevingne's BBMAs Behavior</h2><p>Following the viral clips of Delevingne playing with Megan Thee Stallion's dress at the BBMAs, Banks went on a Twitter rant to defend the model. "Cara doesn't have an obsession with black women. It's that upper crust English society full of fake white and jealous people who were never as charismatic as she is that made fake friendships, tried sabotaging her every which way she moved and the intense jealousy," she tweeted, adding that Delevingne was actually used for clout.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Everyone always wanted to use Cara for what they could get from her, and luckily for her – none of them got anything substantial," Banks continued, "deep down I could tell she was (like me) so used to being told ur a bad person that she began to believe those things about her self. That's my girl thru and thru." We're guessing she didn't really mind that "crazy" concert incident with Delevingne.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Did The Cast Of 'Uncut Gems' Actually Like Julia Fox?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dn8KttcBmnaiwXZius62MnZylnaaeu6i6xGadnq2Unruoew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
