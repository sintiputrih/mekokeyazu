When a fan <a href=#>on Twitter</a> asked him about Spelling's TV lie detector test, Priestley replied, "Didn't watch." But he definitely heard what his former co-star said about him. After another fan wrote, "Tori Says: I Slept with Jason...true or false?" Priestley <a href=#>responded</a> with, "I'm not getting into this... It's nobody's business... Either way."</p><p>Priestley also noted that he has nothing bad to say about his former TV show. "I'm only speaking with negativity about the Lifetime movie and Tori's lie detector... Nothing but love for 90210," he <a href=#>wrote</a>.</p><p>The prior year, Priestley told <a href=#>Access</a>&nbsp;that while he did engage with some of his female co-stars, Spelling was not one of them — because she was the daughter of "Beverly Hills, 90210" producer Aaron Spelling. The actor added that he considered the legendary TV producer to be much more than his boss. "Aaron was a great friend and a great mentor and a great teacher," Priestley said before noting that the famed producer let him direct an episode of the show at age 23. "In the end, I started producing the show with him and executive produced the show with him for two seasons. He really invited me into his inner circle in and taught me the television business in a way that nobody else could." Priestley said. "He was a great, great, great man.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamppZoZ4go6jmKynnmK9s7XErKulnalis621zaBksKGknXqjsdWeqaWxXZ22rbjSZnBpamFleqS7jKyrmqpdqbyztYysp56knJ67qHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
