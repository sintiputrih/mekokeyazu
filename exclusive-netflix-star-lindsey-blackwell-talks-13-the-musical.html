The cast is full of young talent, singing their hearts out and making it through the trials and tribulations of adolescence. We’re reminded of the struggle to fit in and fall in love, and of the beauty of friendship, and the nurturing and forgiveness it often needs. The lessons in&nbsp;13 the Musical&nbsp;are plentiful.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=346 data-current-count=346 data-injectable=false>One of the stand-out stars of the musical is Lindsey Blackwell, who plays Kendra — the friend everyone needs at 13. She’s kind and thoughtful, and even though Kendra struggles with the expectations her mother puts on her and the strict nature in which she parents her, Kendra has dreams, one of which is to finally kiss the boy she likes.</p><p data-characters=165 data-current-count=511 data-injectable=true>We got to speak with Blackwell about her role in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>13 the Musical</strong></a>, and the extraordinary opportunity to work with Jason Robert Brown on the stellar project.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=360 data-current-count=360 data-injectable=false>Blackwell is a talented actress, but she also loves to sing and use the platform she’s building for advocacy, especially for young women. From an EP she plans to release soon, to the work she’s done with Girls For A Change, you can learn more about her career and the exciting time she had creating everyone’s new favorite musical adpatation.</p><p data-characters=548 data-current-count=908 data-injectable=true>WGTC: 13: the Musical is such a coming-of-age story, but not in the way we normally see them being told. What about the project initially drew you to it?<br><strong>Blackwell</strong>: Doing a musical is something I have always wanted to do, since I had the chance to be in a live theater production of Madeline’s Christmas. So, when I got the audition, I was super excited. It is such a blessing to be able to sing, dance, and act in a project. Plus, Kendra’s character was so very sweet and kind, and I totally felt like she and I had so much in common.</p><p data-characters=462 data-current-count=462 data-injectable=true>We’re living in an age where kids and young adults are freer than ever to dig into their emotions and stresses and sort through them instead of bottling them all up to fit a mold. 13 The Musical really embraces that. What was a favorite area of growth for your character, Kendra?<br><strong>Blackwell</strong>: I think Kendra’s ability to forgive was my favorite area of growth for her. She was able to mend her closest relationships and move past her sadness into joy.</p><p data-characters=462 data-current-count=462 data-injectable=true>What was it like working with Jason Robert Brown?<br><strong>Blackwell</strong>: Jason is the funniest person that I have ever met. He makes the most sarcastic jokes, but at the same time he is extremely uplifting and makes you feel confident in your skills and abilities. You know with him it is all love. I think one of the funniest things I remember him saying to me in rehearsals or during studio time was “take it to church.” Jason is the absolute best and just brilliant.</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=217 data-injectable=false>Did he have much involvement in the movie’s musical direction?<br><strong>Blackwell</strong>: He was there with us, in rehearsals and pre-records, always coming up with some jazzy addition to the amazing stuff he already composed!</p><p data-characters=610 data-current-count=827 data-injectable=true>How did the vocal coach work with you on ensuring the songs were sung healthily since there can be quite a bite with some numbers?<br><strong>Blackwell</strong>: We had an amazing vocal coach, Chris York, that would do our zoom sessions with us and teach us the best techniques to achieve the tone we needed, hit the notes, really protect our voices. One of my favorite memories with Chris is when we would change the beginning consonant of a word to make the note easier to hit, but the funny part is how weird it would sound. I also think at one point he had me singing through a straw… the things we do to hit that note.</p><p data-characters=430 data-current-count=430 data-injectable=true>Have you ever been the new kid at school? How did you cope with that?<br><strong>Blackwell</strong>: I have been the new kid at school, and thankfully I don’t have any horror stories from my first day as a new kid. However, for the first day of fifth grade at a new school, I wore a mohawk with buns. People wouldn’t stop saying the buns look like meatballs; it’s kind of funny now, but it definitely wasn’t funny to me then.</p><p data-characters=216 data-current-count=216 data-injectable=false>For anyone who isn’t familiar with 13 The Musical, how would you describe it in 3 words?<br><strong>Blackwell</strong>: 13: The Musical in 3 words, wow, that’s hard. I think I’d go with wholesome, upbeat, and diverse.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=516 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=604 data-current-count=604 data-injectable=true>Were you a fan of the production before you signed on for the Netflix adaptation? If so, did you have any favorite songs/characters?<br><strong>Blackwell</strong>: Before signing on with Netflix for the role of Kendra, I was familiar with 13 and knew that Ariana Grande and Liz Gillies made their debut on Broadway and went on to have amazing careers. I also knew that Jason Robert Brown was an amazing composer, and I was so excited to be able to work with him. Now, I am a huge fan, of course, and I love that I am a part of bringing a new song and storyline to life with Kendra and “I’ve Been Waiting”!</p><p data-characters=612 data-current-count=612 data-injectable=true>Kendra really wants things to work out with her crush, Brett, including getting that highly-anticipated first kiss. She also feels a little bit stuck because her mother is quite strict — did you relate to anything Kendra went through in the adaptation? If not, is there another character who you related to more?<br><strong>Blackwell</strong>: I can relate to Kendra’s kindness and her being able to forgive people after an apology. I would say I’m a forgiving person if people deserve forgiveness. Lucy and Brett both apologized for where they went wrong, and Kendra was able to step back and accept their apologies.</p><p data-characters=536 data-current-count=536 data-injectable=true>Tell us about your work with Girls For A Change. We read more about the organization, and its mission is incredible.<br><strong>Blackwell</strong>: Girls For A Change is an organization that focuses on giving young girls the support they need as they enter womanhood. Their mission is to prepare Black girls for the world, and the world for Black girls. I am a proud advocate of GFAC because I believe that as young women, we need a space free of judgment where we can be our complete selves. The staff and girls participating are such a joy to be around.</p><p data-characters=483 data-current-count=483 data-injectable=true>Between acting and your accolades in school, it seems like you’re not just balancing a lot — but genuinely embracing all of your dreams and achieving success in so much. How do you balance so much at such a young age?<br><strong>Blackwell</strong>: Balancing it all can be tough at times, but allowing personal time for myself really makes the difference. I will forever emphasize the importance of self-love and a little alone time! I love doing my hair and nails, so I make the time to do so!</p><p data-characters=554 data-current-count=554 data-injectable=true>You’ve also worked on projects like Council of Dads (which we loved), The Change-Up, and Temptation: Confessions of a Marriage Counselor — is there a genre of acting you’d like to explore more of? Which has been the most fulfilling so far?<br><strong>Blackwell</strong>: I definitely want to explore comedy more because people always say I’m kind of funny, and I believe them. Drama is always the most fulfilling because there are so many chances to touch your audience in a positive way through relatable moments. I always love doing drama productions.</p><p data-characters=505 data-current-count=505 data-injectable=true>Working on a musical aligns with your other passions of piano playing and singing. How has it been crafting your debut EP?<br><strong>Blackwell</strong>: Working on my EP was such a blast. Music is a really big part of my life, and being able to professionally put my voice out there is unbelievable! My first single came out on August 19, and I am extremely grateful for the support from my fans. The response from people definitely made me want to put out more music in the future! Be on the lookout for my EP coming soon.</p><p data-characters=304 data-current-count=304 data-injectable=false>Last but not least, what do you most hope fans take away from 13 The Musical?<br><strong>Blackwell</strong>: I hope fans realize that, more times than not, everyone deserves a second chance. 13: The Musical really does a great job of showing how important forgiveness is and also never to take your friendships for granted!</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=304 data-injectable=false></p><p data-characters=254 data-current-count=558 data-injectable=true>It’s easy to forget how lucky we are to have strong friendships, and it can be hard to offer forgiveness when we’ve been wrong. Blackwell’s takeaway from the film is one that viewers of all ages can benefit from being reminded of.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=149 data-current-count=149 data-injectable=false>You can see Netflix’s adaptation of&nbsp;13: the Musical&nbsp;on the streaming platform now, and it’s a beautiful watch for family and friends.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8SxmqWto57DpnnNnqufpJmterTAwKtkpaGemcCmxYybo5qbm6yyrbiMrZilo6NifnR506GcZqWlqLakrcto</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
