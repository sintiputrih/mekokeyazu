The 24-year-old righthander—one of five Dodgers in the Top 100—recalls pitching in the New England Collegiate League following his freshman season at Butler.
“I kind of got shelled because I didn’t have a changeup,” Pepiot said. “I was basically throwing fastballs all the time, and if you throw fastballs all the time to good college hitters, you’re going to get hit around."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I worked on that all offseason into the fall and just continuously refined it as time has gone on.”</p><p>That grip is “a circle-change off of basically the same grip as my fastball so it comes out with the same spin out of my hand as my fastball,” he said.</p><p>Armed with that plus-plus changeup, Pepiot is on the verge of MLB, having made his Triple-A debut in August 2021. It didn’t go well. Pepiot had a 7.13 ERA in 11 games for Oklahoma City.</p><p>Refining the arsenal around his changeup has been the 6-foot-3, 215-pound righthander’s focus this offseason.</p><p>“Definitely working on my offspeed pitches, landing those for strikes. That’s been a big emphasis this offseason,” he said, mentioning a hard slider and a slower, sweeping slider to mix in with his fastball, curveball and changeup.</p><p>“I’m starting to feel good about my whole arsenal all around,” Pepiot said. “Having five tools in the tool box now and being able to throw those where I want to when I want to is definitely going to help me solidify things as a starter and hopefully get a chance to go up to Dodger Stadium at some point.”</p><p><strong>L.A. CONFIDENTIAL</strong></p><p>— <a href=# class="player-linker-link mce-player-linker">Scott Hennessey</a> (Double-A Tulsa) and <a href=# class="player-linker-link mce-player-linker">Austin Chubb</a> (High-A Great Lakes) will return as managers in the Dodgers’ farm system for the 2022 season.
