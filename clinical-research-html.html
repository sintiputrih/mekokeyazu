The purpose of the study is to learn whether the muscles on the medial side of the elbow can help prevent ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) injuries to the elbow. Additionally, we want to know whether measurements of the strength of these muscles can be used to predict elbow injuries.<strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Femoroacetabular Impingement (FAI): The Effectiveness of Physical Therapy Protocol:<br></strong>PI: Scott Mullen, MD; Paul Schroeppel, MD<br>Sponsor: Steadman Hawkins Clinic - Denver<br>By doing this observational study, researchers hope to learn if physical therapy helps patients with FAI reduce pain and inflammation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Fixator Debridement<br></strong>PI: Archie Heddings, MD.<br>The purpose is to review whether performing an irrigation and debridement of the pin sites on patients that underwent external fixator removal, decreased post-operative infection rates.</p><p><strong>Multi-Center Prospective Evaluation of Operative versus Nonoperative Treatment for Adult Spinal Deformity: Differentiating Clinical and Radiographic Features and Evaluation of Treatment Outcomes</strong><br>International Spine Study Group<br>Douglas Burton, MD, Principal Investigator<br>Compared to adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, operative treatment of adult scoliosis is associated with higher complication rates, prolonged recovery time, and greater economic cost. Postoperative outcomes are often compromised by complications and revision surgery. Consequently, physicians must carefully weigh the risk/benefit ratio when deciding upon operative or nonoperative treatment of adult scoliosis. There is little data currently available that considers age stratification of adult deformity patients treated operatively versus nonoperatively and followed over a period of time as regards clinical and radiographic outcomes. Psychological distress is known to have a negative impact on the outcomes of patients undergoing spine surgery.&nbsp; No data exists studying the adult spinal deformity patient population with regard to psychological distress and outcome after surgery. The potential implications of this study include identifying and appropriately treating patients with significant distress and ultimately adding a data point to the surgical decision-making process.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Prospective Radiographic and Clinical Evaluation of Surgical Treatment for Cervical Deformity: A Multi-Center Study</strong><br>International Spine Study Group<br>Douglas Burton, MD, Principal Investigator<br>This study aims to define the clinical and demographic features of the population affected by cervical deformities such as cervical kyphosis, cervical scoliosis, and basilar invagination. The study will assess for correlations between radiographic parameters and degree of pain/disability at baseline and assess and describe surgical strategies used to address the deformity and evaluate clinical outcome at 2 years following surgery.</p><p><strong>Mature Runners: The Effect of Training Shoes upon Running Kinematics:<br></strong>PI: E Bruce Toby, MD; Scott Mullen, MD; Heath Melugin, MD; Damon Mar, MS; Terence McIff, Ph.D.<br>The purpose of this study is to learn whether the type of shoe a mature runner wears causes him/her to strike the ground differently.</p><p><strong>A Phase 2b, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Staphylococcus Aureus 4-Antigen Vaccine (SA4Ag) in Adults Undergoing Elective Open Posterior Spinal Fusion Procedures with Multilevel Instrumentation<br></strong>PI: Douglas Burton, MD; Sean Jackson, MD.<br>Sponsor: Pfizer<br>SA4Ag is an investigational vaccine being studied to determine whether vaccination with SA4Ag, given 10 to 60 days before surgery, can help prevent infections after surgery caused by staph.</p><p><strong>METRC Studies:<br></strong>PI: Michael Tilley, MD; John Sojka, MD; Archie Heddings, MD.

While biomechanical studies support the use of the FCL for the treatment of long bone fractures, there are very few clinical studies published to date either supporting or detracting from the use of the technology. The significance of the proposed research is to compare treatment outcomes both radiographically and clinically to standard treatment techniques to determine if there is a difference in clinical outcomes.</p><p><strong>Pain and Activity Level Related to Spine Surgery and Patient Outcomes</strong><br>PI: Brittany Melton, MD; Neena Sharma, MD; Douglas Burton, MD.<br>Researchers hope to learn about the relationship between pain management and activity level immediately after spine surgery and patient outcomes/healthcare costs after going home.</p><p><strong>A Prospective, Multicenter Study of Instrumented Posterolateral Lumbar Fusions (PLF) with OsteoAMP to Evaluate Long-Term Safety and Efficacy in Patients Requiring 1-2 Level Instrumented PLF.</strong><br>PI: Douglas Burton, MD; Sean Jackson, MD.<br>Sponsor: Bioventus, LLC<br>This study is a post market study to gather long term safety and effectiveness of OsteoAMP.</p><p><strong>Lisfranc Injuries and Cost and Complications of Treatment, Comparison of ORIF and Primary Fusion, A PearlDiver Study</strong><br>PI: Bryan Vopat, MD.; Brandon Barnds, MD.; William Tucker, MD<br>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of operative vs non-operative treatments of lisfranc injuries, using data from the PearlDiver database.</p><p><strong>Meniscal Tears: Cost, Sex Analysis and Progression to Knee Arthroplasty (KA), Comparison of Non-Operative Management versus Arthroscopic Partial Meniscectomy (APM), A PearlDiver Study.</strong><br>PI: Bryan Vopat, MD.; Brandon Barnds, MD.; Brandon Morris, MD.; Paul Schroeppel, MD.; Scott Mullen, MD.; Armin Tarakemeh<br>This study will use the PearlDiver database to compare the cost, sex treatment trends, and progression to KA associated with meniscal tears in subjects treated non-operatively and in those treated with APM.</p><p><strong>Survival of Carpal Instability Procedures, a PearlDiver Study.</strong><br>PI: E.
