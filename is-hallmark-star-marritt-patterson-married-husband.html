Patterson was visibly wearing an engagement ring on her wedding finger in the black-and-white image. She simply captioned the photo, "08.12.21," alongside a white heart emoji. Following this news, the Hallmark Channel star was interviewed for an <a href=#>Over the Moon</a> blog post as she and her partner, a talent agent named JR Ringer, were tying the knot in a 2022 ceremony that took place in Italy. "You can't go wrong in Italy! The people, the food, the landscape — everything is incredible," Patterson said.&nbsp;</p><p>In the post, it was also shared that the spouses had first crossed paths at a music festival five years prior to the nuptials. When the two wed, their immediate family members and just a few close companions were present.&nbsp;During the intimate wedding, the attendees were not occupied with distractions, as they turned off their cell phones at the event. "We wanted the ceremony to really reflect us as a couple and what we value — not necessarily what's traditional," Patterson said. In addition, the actor revealed a photo of herself and Ringer smiling on their wedding day, per <a href=#>Instagram</a>. Patterson has previously shown some special moments with Ringer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtlZX10fo6iqmagkaG5rq3RpGSsrJGneq6t0augraxdpa61wMSrqqimXaKus77InptmoKWor6K6w2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
