Duchess Kate has always been a style icon, even before having her royal title. She constantly looks classy, even when she’s dressed casually and wrangling up her little princes and princess. Of course, being a duchess, her clothes and shoes aren’t always quite within our price range. While we love to admire her fashion picks, we’re often left feeling a little disappointed that we can’t justify grabbing them for ourselves!"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She constantly looks classy, even when she’s dressed casually and wrangling up her little princes and princess. Of course, being a duchess, her clothes and shoes aren’t always quite within our price range. While we love to admire her fashion picks, we’re often left feeling a little disappointed that we can’t justify grabbing them for ourselves!</p><p>Take her $695 Penelope Chivers riding boots, for example. She’s been wearing them since 2004 (at least!) and we love them so much, but are we willing to spend nearly $700 on them? We’d be too afraid to ruin them! But you know what? It’s okay, because <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this similar pair </a>from Amazon starts under $30!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/kate-middleton-boots.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DREAM PAIRS Women’s Koson Knee High Winter Riding Boots</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$29</a> at Amazon!

Of course, we’re not just going to go for the first dupe that catches our eye. We’re still about quality. That’s why we’re specifically recommending <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this pair with nearly 900 reviews</a>!</p><p>Shoppers say not to hesitate when it comes to picking up a pair of these riding boots. They guarantee that the quality is excellent and that they’re so comfortable. Even those who normally avoid online shoe shopping at all costs are so happy they took the risk and think we should all do the same!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DREAM PAIRS Women’s Koson Knee High Winter Riding Boots</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$29</a> at Amazon!

As your eyes make their way up, you may also notice two zippers: one shining on the outside and one rising from the instep. The outside one is purely for visual purposes, but the inner one is there to help you get these boots on and off with ease!</p><p>The inside of this shoe is just as impressive as the outside, with a padded insole and a warm and cozy faux-fur lining. And if the outside is less of your style, don’t click away — because this boot is also available in other versions, including lace-up! Your royal style awaits — all you have to do is add it to your cart!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DREAM PAIRS Women’s Koson Knee High Winter Riding Boots</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$29</a> at Amazon!
