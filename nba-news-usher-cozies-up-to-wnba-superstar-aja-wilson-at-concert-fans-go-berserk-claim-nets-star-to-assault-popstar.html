There have become more and more players in the WNBA who are slowly becoming stars and household names. One of those players is<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> A’ja Wilson</a></strong>. At 27 years old, A’ja Wilson is part of the Las Vegas Aces, a team that recently went back-to-back in the NBA finals.</p><p>Being based in Las Vegas, she gets a lot of opportunities to attend shows of megastars. The latest show she attended was the Las Vegas show of American singer, songwriter, and dancer – Usher. While the show in itself was excellent, what caught the eyes of many was the fact that Usher was serenading A’ja Wilson during the concert.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>In a video that has gone viral, Usher can be seen cozying up to Wilson. Many have suggested that Usher’s actions could lead to him being confronted by NBA star<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Mikal Bridges</a></strong>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Bridges had recently left a very suggestive comment on and Instagram post Wilson had made, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">suggesting he was interested in her</a>. However, he was quickly shut down by Wilson, who said he was lost. Wilson was seen cozying up to Usher during the show as well, something that could cause a rift between the NBA star and the performer.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nba-fans-react-to-a-ja-wilson-and-usher-cozying-up>NBA fans react to A’ja Wilson and Usher cozying up</h2><p>NBA fans went wild after seeing Wilson and Usher getting close to each other at the concert. Many suggested that Bridges would seen be coming to beat Usher up, after seeing him with Wilson.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/usher-aja-wilson-parade-102523-tout-6f4c7bf5418f4251a1f0ef3b596aafad-1200x800.jpg><p>They took to Twitter to share their opinion. One fan commented, “Mikal Bridges is gonna beat his ass.” Here’s what others had to say:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Most of the incident was in jest, however, and it is unlikely Bridges will actually confront Usher about the incident. It remains to be seen where Wilson and Usher go after this and whether or not their interaction at the show was merely playful banter or something more serious.</p><p><strong>In Case You Missed:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57zZuYZqaVrMBuwdKhnKtlk6THqrHSZqypZaSkeri6wZpkrK2gmr%2B0wMCrZJqikWLEqrjSqKVmmaRisLC6wp6prWWWlru0ecaoZJudoqiys7eMnKOaoZ1iu6bA0maqrZmiYsGwecCsqpqtnKl6sbvPrKuaql8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
