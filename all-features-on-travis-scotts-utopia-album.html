In continuing with his expert concept projects, La Flame tapped some of the music industry’s biggest names to ensure a diverse and versatile project. Utopia features artists from a wide variety of genres, showcasing Scott’s knack for musical storytelling.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=232 data-current-count=232 data-injectable=false>Following the acclaimed Astroworld five years ago, the heat’s been on Travis Scott to release another full-length album. The success that was his third project instilled fear in fans that a monumental feat could not be replicated.</p><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=571 data-injectable=true>Fortunately, whether by taking his sweet time, or drawing from a plethora of experiences, Utopia is a solid body of work, albeit with 19 tracks and over 73 minutes. While Scott delivers as usual, there’s a focus on his heap of featured artists, which range from Beyoncé to Bon Iver, to James Blake, and even Scott’s daughter Stormi.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-kaycyy-and-stormi-thank-god data-injectable=false>KayCyy and Stormi (“THANK GOD”)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=342 data-current-count=642 data-injectable=true>Kenyan-American artist KayCyy is featured on the second single, “THANK GOD.” Both artists came through swinging, making it a memorable song, with KayCyy delivering the song’s chorus. Scott’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">daughter Stormi, whom he shares with Kylie Jenner</a> is also featured on the track, providing a short approval to one of her dad’s lines.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=190 data-current-count=190 data-injectable=false>Although the song is well done, it has garnered some criticism from fans and from KayCyy. This is because Travis Scott did not credit him on the track for his singing, only as a songwriter.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Teezo Touchdown (“MODERN JAM”)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=490 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=160 data-current-count=160 data-injectable=false>Teezo Touchdown joins Scott for track three, “MODERN JAM.” The pair chant together on the chorus, while Teezo takes on the third verse all on his own.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=184 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false>The song is well-regarded, with fans becoming obsessed with its production, vocals, and flow. Teezo felt like a natural fit for the song, contributing to the 80s vibe the song exudes.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Bon Iver and Sampha (“MY EYES”)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=644 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=255 data-injectable=false>Travis Scott tapped two soulful crooners for Utopia’s fourth track, “MY EYES.” Both artists have brief moments on the project. While <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bon Iver</a> handles the emotive pre-chorus, Sampha delicately delivers the second verse with his signature sound.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=213 data-current-count=468 data-injectable=true>Listeners responded well to the collab, expressing that it sounded just like what they expected it to with Frank Ocean working on it. The mixture of the artists’ talents and sounds made it a stand-out song.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Drake (“MELTDOWN”)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=306 data-current-count=606 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Drake</a> and Travis Scott are frequent collaborators, so it’s no surprise the pair are at it again on Utopia. “MELTDOWN” is the seventh track on the album, and is a crowd-pleaser. Drake starts off the track, delivering the pre-chorus and the lengthy first verse before Scott takes over the record.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=217 data-injectable=false>The transitions and production of the song were especially appreciated by listeners, as is the way the two artists bounce off each other. Many have now requested a collaboration album to get to hear more of the pair.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Playboi Carti and Sheck Wes (“FE!N”)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=517 data-injectable=true>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDTKfTj198o</figure><p data-characters=192 data-current-count=192 data-injectable=false>Upon the album’s release, fans were eager to know the featured artists on “FE!N”. The correct answer is Playboi Carti and Sheck Wes, who provide their signature sound to the track.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=192 data-current-count=384 data-injectable=false>Listeners have described this song as giving the same energy as being at a crazy fun concert. Scott and Carti make a great pair in creating a song that gets people hyped and wanting to dance.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Beyoncé and Bon Iver (“DELRESTO (ECHOES)”)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=684 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=398 data-injectable=false>Bon Iver returns for the ninth track, this time joined by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Beyoncé</a>. The Queen Bey raps in the first verse and accompanies Scott in the second verse with sultry, airy vocals. In addition to these, Beyoncé also sings on the pre-chorus and chorus, as well as the third and fifth verses. Bon Iver’s frontman, Justice Vernon provides the intro, and outro, and joins Beyoncé on the third verse.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=157 data-current-count=555 data-injectable=true>I mean, no one expected a song with both a Beyoncé and a Bon Iver feature to be anything short of amazing. It delivered, making it another stand-out track.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Rob49 and 21 Savage (“TOPIA TWINS”)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=181 data-current-count=481 data-injectable=true>Rising star Rob49 raps hard and vigorously on “TOPIA TWINS,” the 11th track on Utopia. 21 Savage raps on the second, third, and fourth verses, as well as the final chorus.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=233 data-current-count=233 data-injectable=false>Although some listeners have declared that they didn’t like it on the first listen, it has the ability to grow on people. The energy it creates thanks to the organ piano and Rob49’s verses end up making it a strong song.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Swae Lee and The Weeknd (“CIRCUS MAXIMUS”)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=533 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=177 data-current-count=177 data-injectable=false>Swae Lee and The Weeknd provide brief vocals on Utopia’s 12th track, “CIRCUS MAXIMUS.” While the former takes on the intro, the latter delivers the chorus and outro.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=162 data-current-count=339 data-injectable=false>Another hit collaboration. Listeners appreciated Travis’ vocal flow and deemed The Weekend’s part as one of the most underrated elements of the song.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Dave Chappelle and Yung Lean (“PARASAIL”)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=639 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=265 data-injectable=false>Popular standup comedian, Dave Chappelle provides the motivational intro to the track, “PARASAIL.” He shows up again towards the end of the song, during the bridge. Joining him and Scott on the bridge is Yung Lean, who also sings the pre-chorus and outro.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=141 data-current-count=406 data-injectable=true>This one feels a little underwhelming. Chappelle’s intro feels awkward on the track, although the rest of it feels a bit more natural.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Young Thug (“SKITZO”)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=524 data-injectable=true>Hip Hop veteran <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Young Thug</a> raps alongside Scott on the chorus of “SKITZO” before delivering the second verse. In his signature style, Young Thug raps about the lavish lifestyle, floating on the beat while doing so.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=82 data-current-count=82 data-injectable=false>Scott and Young Thug have complimentary flows that allow the song to really soar.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Westside Gunn and James Blake (“LOST FOREVER”)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=617 data-injectable=true>Scott tapped rapper Westside Gunn and singer James Blake for the track, “LOST FOREVER.” Blake’s vocals are low on the song, while Gunn raps brashly about his lifestyle in the first verse, then alongside Scott in the second.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=231 data-injectable=false>The biggest complaint listeners have when it comes to this song is that there isn’t an extended version. It is complimented for being haunting and beautiful and the way the drums and bass seamlessly change to a higher pitch.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Kid Cudi (“LOOOVE”)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=531 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=228 data-current-count=228 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kid Cudi</a>’s appearance on “LOOOOVE” isn’t until the third verse, but it still packs a punch. The 16th track is an almost psychedelic one, with enough bass and oomph to be one of Utopia’s most radio-friendly songs.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=99 data-current-count=327 data-injectable=false>From the intro to Kid Cudi’s conclusion, the song is one of the most supreme collaborations.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Bad Bunny and The Weeknd (“K-POP”)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=627 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=252 data-injectable=false>“K-POP” was released on July 21 as the first official single off Utopia. A standout track, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bad Bunny</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Weeknd</a> provide pop and funk vibes to the song. Easily one of the most commercial songs on the album, “K-POP” is a fun dance-rap hybrid.</p><p data-characters=159 data-current-count=411 data-injectable=true>This song isn’t most people’s favorite. The commercial aspect makes it blend together with other songs of its kind, making it kind of forgettable.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Future and SZA (“TELEKINESIS”)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=216 data-current-count=516 data-injectable=true>“TELEKINESIS” is the penultimate track on Utopia. It’s also one of the longest records on the album. Future and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SZA</a> provide accompanying vocals and lyrics for an introspective track about what the future holds.</p><p data-characters=137 data-current-count=137 data-injectable=false>Scott, Future, and SZA complement each other well, making for an energetic collab. SZA’s part in general is unexpected but killer.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>21 Savage and James Blake (“TIL FURTHER NOTICE”)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=437 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=172 data-current-count=172 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">21 Savage</a> and James Blake return for the final track on the album. “TIL FURTHER NOTICE” is emotional and weighty, with a heavy punch that closes the album out in style.</p><p data-characters=114 data-current-count=286 data-injectable=false>Blake’s beautiful voice gives the song a ghostly feeling and is a phenomenal conclusion to the entire album.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SurbiMn5yarKWnsrR5zqdkraqRq7a0edKcpq2so2LCtbvPophmmZyXwq57</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
