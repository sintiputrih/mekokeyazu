Going a little over the series’ average runtime of 43 minutes, Ahsoka Episode 5 will clock in at 49 minutes and 50 seconds. While the series debut episode still remains the longest so far, running for 54 minutes and 21 seconds, episode 5 will mark some significant developments in the series.</p><p data-characters=457 data-current-count=457 data-injectable=true>A substantial portion of the episode is anticipated to focus on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the relationship between Ahsoka and Anakin Skywalker</a>, and viewers may even be treated to some flashbacks featuring Anakin from the Clone Wars era. And if the theatrical release is any indication of a big moment coming in, fans may be on the brink of witnessing the live-action debut of Grand Admiral Thrawn in the final moments of episode 5, akin to the impactful entry of Anakin in episode 4.</p><p data-characters=64 data-current-count=64 data-injectable=false>Here are all 10 theaters screening Ahsoka Episode 5 on Sept. 12:</p><ul data-current-count=789 data-injectable=true><li>AMC Assembly Row 12 in Boston, Massachusetts</li><li>AMC Showplace Village Crossing 18 in Chicago, Illinois</li><li>AMC NorthPark 15 IMAX in Dallas, Texas</li><li>AMC The Grove 14 in Los Angeles, California</li><li>AMC Empire 25 IMAX in New York, New York</li><li>AMC Disney Springs 24 with Dine-In Theaters in Orlando, Florida</li><li>AMC Neshaminy 24 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</li><li>AMC Bay Street 16 in San Francisco, California</li><li>AMC Loews Alderwood Mall 16 in Seattle, Washington</li><li>AMC Tysons Corner 16 in Washington, DC</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Sabine-Ahsoka-Star-Wars-remixAsh.jpg><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=681 data-injectable=true>While the previous four episodes were packed with intense action sequences and the introduction of new characters, Episode 5 promises to explore deeper emotional aspects. Ahsoka will seek catharsis and closure to her unresolved survivor’s guilt after Anakin and countless other Jedi were murdered in Order 66. Hopefully, Ahsoka Tano will emerge as her true warrior self soon.</p><p data-characters=181 data-current-count=181 data-injectable=false>For the majority who could not get in for the theatrical screening, Ahsoka episode 5 will also premiere as usual <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">on Disney Plus at<strong>&nbsp;</strong>9:00 p.m. ET / 6:00 p.m. PT</a> on Tuesday, Sept. 15.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yitNKooppllaW2tLvDnmRuZaKqu7W1zJ5krJuimrKvtc2gZKKmXam1pq3TnqmsZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
