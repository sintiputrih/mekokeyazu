Thankfully, Mando has done a pretty swell job keeping The Child (real name: Grogu) safe for us. But now that The Mandalorian isn’t slated to return until 2022, we are going to be missing that little Jedi to bits for potentially over a year. That’s why we need to bring him to us!</p><p>With a Baby Yoda bag or backpack in your arsenal, you can carry that little cutie around with you everywhere you go, just like Mando does. Season 3 might still be a ways away, but you don’t have to wait that long to see him again. Check out these bags and backpacks we found on Amazon and you could be reunited with him in just a couple of days!</p><p><strong>This Mini Backpack</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/baby-yoda-backpack-frog.jpg><p>This intricately designed backpack is incredible.
