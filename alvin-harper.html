Cowboys</span></h4><p>Furthermore, Harper was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the first round (12th overall) of the 1991 NFL Draft to find a receiving partner for starter Michael Irvin.</p><p>He caught 20 passes for 326 yards and one touchdown as a rookie, helping Dallas finish 11–5, its first winning season since 1985.</p><p>He missed the seventh game against the Cincinnati Bengals because

touchdowns.</p><p>He probably had the signature play of his career during the NFC Championship against the <strong>San Francisco 49ers</strong>, catching a slant route for 70 yards, setting up the Cowboys on the 10-yard line, and sealing the win.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>AQ Shipley Bio: Early Life, NFL, Personal Life & Net Worth>></a></strong></p><h4>Third/Fourth Season with Dallas Cowboys&nbsp;</h4><p>Similarly, Harper also caught a 45-yard touchdown from quarterback <a href=#>Troy Aikman</a> during the 52–17 victory over the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXVII.</p><p>He dunked the ball over the goalpost crossbar.</p><p>In 1993, Harper established himself as one of the best deep threats in the NFL with a 21.6 yards per catch average and a total of 36 receptions for 777 yards and five touchdowns.</p><p>Alvin again had a key play in the NFC Championship against the San Francisco 49ers after <a href=#>Troy Aikman</a> was knocked out of the game with a concussion.&nbsp;</p><p>During the game, Dallas backup quarterback Bernie Kosar connected with Harper for a 42-yard touchdown.</p><p>That year, Dallas returned to face the Bills in Super Bowl XXVIII, during which Aikman completed a 16-yard pass to give the Cowboys a first-and-goal at the six early in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Thus, that set up a one-yard run by running back Emmitt Smith and helped seal the Bills’ fate as Dallas won 30–13.</p><p>Nonetheless, Harper’s best year came in 1994, when he led the league with a 24.9 yards-per-reception average, catching 33 passes for 821 yards and eight

yards and one touchdown.</p><p>His top receiving game came in the third game against the Denver Broncos, making 2 receptions for 77 yards and one touchdown.</p><p>Similarly, Harper had 4 receptions for 41 yards and no touchdowns in the fifth game against the Detroit Lions.</p><p>Harper was replaced with Robb Thomas in the second half of the sixth game against the Minnesota Vikings and would lose his job as the starter at wide receiver.</p><p>Thus, Harper started once more in the season finale against the Chicago Bears, in place of an injured Thomas.</p><p>On June 10, 1997, the Buccaneers released Alvin before the start of the season.</p><p>During his two years in Tampa, he was slowed by injuries and played in only 25 games, where he caught 65 passes for 922 yards and three touchdowns.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Miles Boykin Bio: Football, Career, NFL, Family & Net worth>></a></strong></p><h4><span id=Washington_Redskins class=mw-headline>Washington
