Well, making marriage work is indeed hard, but put the stress of being restaurateurs on top of that, and you’re walking on thin ice. Just as the trailer questioned the show’s journey for these couples “The perfect pairing or a recipe for disaster?”</span></p><p><span>All excited for the world to see him on the show, James took it to his IG on the premiere day to write, “#MeOrTheMenu Premieres June 30 at 10|9c June 30 at 10 @foodnetwork @discoveryplus @firstnamejessica”</span></p><p><span>Joining James and Jessica for the inaugural season of </span><i><span>Me or the Menu</span></i><span> were their co-stars — Kathleen and Nate (owners of an Italian cuisine food truck), Nicole and Alan (owners of </span><i><span>Greenios</span></i><span>, a vegan burger restaurant), and Jeanette and Randi (owner of </span><i><span>Leland</span></i><span>).</span></p><p><b>Did you know: </b><span>Unlike his wife, James isn’t new to the TV.
