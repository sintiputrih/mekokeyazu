While today’s Tour de France closely monitors bicyclists to prevent such blatant cheating, fair competition isn’t the only modern benefit. These days, race officials actually care about the well-being of the cyclists. In the early years of the tournament, cyclists rode on unpaved roads without wearing any protective headgear."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In the early years of the tournament, cyclists rode on unpaved roads without wearing any protective headgear.</p><p>Oddly enough, while leather and wool helmets were created in the early 1900s, a bicycle safety helmet standard wasn’t created until the 1970s. Fatal crashes still occur, but injuries were much more common in the race’s early years. Today’s cyclists also have the privilege of riding upon roads with a fresh, even layer of asphalt.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-53108 alt="Tour de France 1937" width=800 height=564 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tour-de-france-1937.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-53108 class=wp-caption-text>A snapshot from the 1937 race.

They had no access to support cars (like today’s riders) and were forced to manage every aspect of the race alone—an unthinkable reality for today’s Tour de France competitors.</p><p>In fact, up until 1930, cyclists were even responsible for making their own repairs—and competitors had to finish the race with the exact same bike (and parts) that they had when they started the race. These rules were actually enforced: in 1913, a cyclist was fined because a boy had stoked the fire that the cyclist used to weld his broken bike.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-53110 alt="Spare Tire Bike Race" width=600 height=851 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tour-de-france-1939-spare-tire.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-53110 class=wp-caption-text>In this picture from the 1930s, a competitor rides with spare tires around his torso in case he needs to repair his bike during the race.

High-profile doping scandals have cast shadows on the international race in recent years (cough cough, Lance Armstrong).</p><p>In addition, cyclists continue to cheat in a variety of forms, though race officials are much better equipped to recognize and penalize these teams and individuals. Despite these flaws, the Tour de France has maintained its position as the world’s most important cycling race…it just took them a little over 100 years to get it right.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-53114 alt="Lance Armstrong" width=800 height=591 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tour-de-france-lance-armstrong.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-53114 class=wp-caption-text>Source: <a href=#>Vos Iz Neias</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony1u9SrZJ2dXZu%2ForrCnmZr</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
