So, there have been rarely such occasions where he talked about his family.

Talking about it, he said then that personally the reason food has been on his radar is because of his dad. He explained that his dad was an excellent cook. So, what we learned from this talk is that his dad’s family is from Iran and because the culture there is obsessed with food, it also became an all-consuming part of his life too.
