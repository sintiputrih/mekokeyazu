Culkin confessed to Ellen De Generes in 2018 that he never knew how much wealth he had amassed from acting till he turned 18 and was granted access to it. He said:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I didn't see it until I turned 18, I call it the 'Slip of Paper' meeting, where they pretty much put a number on a piece of paper and slide it across the table and then—boom! There you go, so I felt like some kid worked really, really hard, and I inherited all of his money pretty much.</p><p><strong>Macaulay Culkin's debut on the big screen was in 1989's Uncle Buck</strong>, for which he received $40,000. However, it was his iconic portrayal of Kevin McCallister in the 1990 blockbuster Home Alone that catapulted him to stardom.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/michael-richards-hasn-t-acted-in-years-but-his-current-yearly-salary-ensures-he-s-more-than-okay-front-deposit-back-commons-licenses.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Michael Richards Hasn't Acted In Years But His Current Yearly Salary Ensures He's More Than Okay</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Starring in Seinfeld has significantly influenced Michael Richards' life, even though he hasn't appeared on screens for quite some time.</span><p>Despite the film's immense success, <strong>Culkin was initially paid $100,000 for his role</strong>, a modest sum considering its impact.
