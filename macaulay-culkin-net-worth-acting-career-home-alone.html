Culkin confessed to Ellen De Generes in 2018 that he never knew how much wealth he had amassed from acting till he turned 18 and was granted access to it. He said:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I didn't see it until I turned 18, I call it the 'Slip of Paper' meeting, where they pretty much put a number on a piece of paper and slide it across the table and thenâ€”boom! There you go, so I felt like some kid worked really, really hard, and I inherited all of his money pretty much.</p><p><strong>Macaulay Culkin's debut on the big screen was in 1989's Uncle Buck</strong>, for which he received $40,000.
