The 36-year-old outspoken conservative delved into much about the 3 and a half years she spent as a co-host on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The View</a>, and according to excerpts of the memoir obtained by the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Daily Mail</a>, she even named the people who she did&nbsp;not&nbsp;enjoy interviewing on the show.

She also said that Whoopi “<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>turned on her</a>” after the two started off on good terms, and that <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Joy Behar</strong></a>‘s diss to Meghan after <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she returned from maternity leave</a> was her last straw before she quit the show.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Bad Republican will be available via Audible on October 21.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe5FpZqadl52ur3nMnJqaoZ5ixLC%2B0q1koK2VqMG0edOhnGaumZrEbq3UnaCoZZ2aurC10Wg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
