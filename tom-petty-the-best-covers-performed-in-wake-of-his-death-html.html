They’re all part of our family,” he said. “So I want to say to them: We hurt for you, and we hurt with you. You can be sure that we’re going to walk through these tough times together, every step of the way.” Following his speech, Aldean and his backing band performed “I Won’t Back Down” to the audience in Studio 8H.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=divider-title><span>Miley Cyrus</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj8j90vap00062c5rxe1p23yx@published data-word-count=43>Capping off her residency week at The Tonight Show, Cyrus was accompanied by her father, Billy Ray Cyrus, to give “Wildflowers” a beautiful and soulful tribute — weaving in a group of fiddles to give it a slightly more country sound as well.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=divider-title><span>Kesha</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj8j90vcr00072c5rv89oci88@published data-word-count=48>“I’m not trying to be a downer, but I just think this is one of the most beautiful songs ever written and I want to pay my respects,” Kesha said about halfway through her Boston performance, promptly launching into a stripped-down rendition of “Into the Great Wide Open.”</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=divider-title><span>Florida football enthusiasts</span></h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>RIP Tom Petty. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/8akHgv3hKd</a></p>— Cody Worsham (@CodyWorsham) <a href=#>October 7, 2017</a><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj8j90ves000a2c5rtex7bkyk@published data-word-count=44>A tense college football game between the Florida Gators and LSU Tigers was temporarily put on hold when the entire stadium broke out into an impromptu sing-along of “I Won’t Back Down.” Petty, a Florida boy, would’ve appreciated the near-perfect harmonizing of 90,000 people.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=divider-title><span>The Killers</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj8kaswup00042c5w8tm5zu7r@published data-word-count=65>“It was just like somebody stabbed you in the heart when you heard that he died,” Killers front man Brandon Flowers told the crowd at the band’s Austin City Limits set, before treating the audience to their take on “The Waiting.” All Flowers needed was the strumming of one electric guitar to accompany him.
