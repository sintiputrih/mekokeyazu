Joe’s net worth is estimated to be $5 million as of 2014.</p><p>He was born on the 31st August 1980 in New York City, New York, in the United States. Despite being unsuccessful in high school, he began rapping with his friends. His career started when he appeared on DJ’s KaySlay’s and DJ’s Clue’s mixtapes. He released his first rap album entitled Pump it Up in early 2003 and then his career took off. His second studio album called Padded Room (2009) immediately entered the US Billboard 200.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=joe-budden-net-worth-5-million></span>Joe Budden Net Worth $5 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Joe is currently not only successful as a solo act, but he is also a member of the hip hop band called Slaughterhouse alongside such rappers as Royce da 5’9’’, Crooked I and Joell Ortiz. One of Joe Budden’s singles was even nominated for an award and featured in the movie called 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) as well as in Madden NFL 2004 and in Def Jam Vendetta. One on his songs also ended up on the soundtrack of the 2004 movie called Mean Girls. This recognition added even more wealth to Joe’s bank account.</p><p>During the period of 2003 to 2013 Joe released a total of six studio albums. He was also active with his band since they also released two albums of their own. Their second album was number two on the famous Billboard 200 Chart as it was the second best Rap Album of the month. During the same time Joe also collaborated with various rappers and other artists. A few to mention would be Busta Rhymes, Eminem, Cee-Lo Green. Not only that, but Budden has also appeared in several documentaries that focused on rap and hip hop culture. One to mention would definitely be the documentary called Something from Nothing: The Art of Rap, although it is safe to say that the second documentary Joe Budden was featured in called Love & Hip Hop became even more successful than the first one. The third one called Hip Hop Babylon came out about a year after the other two, but it was not as successful as the first two movies.</p><p>More recently Joe has formed another rap band called SLV. He has teamed up with several producers and Emanny and is currently active not only with his first band Slaughterhouse but working on a few new projects with the current band. Their single called She Don’t Put It Down sold more than 50,000 copies during the first week after its release.</p><p>Speaking about the personal life, Joe Budden has one child who was born from his previous relationship. Given how many albums Joe has released and how many projects he is involved in it doesn’t surprise anyone that he has successfully accumulated a fortune of about $5 million.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><table><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Joe Budden</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$1.8 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>August 31, 1980</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Harlem, New York City, New York, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Musician, Singer, Rapper</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Trey Budden</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Fay Southerland</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Jo Budden , Joe Buddens , Budden, Joe , Joseph Anthony Budden II , Mouse , Joey Jumpoff</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td>https://www.facebook.com/officialjoebudden</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td>http://www.twitter.com/joebudden</td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td>https://www.instagram.com/joebudden/</td></tr><tr><td>MySpace</td><td>http://www.myspace.com/mousebudden</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1379451</td></tr><tr><td>Allmusic</td><td>www.allmusic.com/artist/joe-budden-mn0000121012</td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>Vibe Next Award (2003)</td></tr><tr><td>Albums</td><td>Some Love Lost (EP, 2014), Padded Room (2009), Pump it Up (2003), Joe Budden (2003), Mood Muzik 2: Can It Get Any Worse?
