After all, this is the man who danced his heart out to Rihanna’s “Umbrella” on international television – a skit which still follows him. It’s safe to say he knows how to have fun.</p><p data-characters=571 data-current-count=571 data-injectable=true>Holland’s known for his friendly personality on social media. Though <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he’s taken a break from his social feeds</a> in the past due to the negativity that can be spread on there (celebrities can receive some very cruel responses), Holland has always been vocal about spreading positivity towards other people. He and his brothers (Sam, Harry, and Paddy Holland) actually run a charity, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Brothers Trust</a>, in order to help out disadvantaged people around the world. Their mission statement is to specifically help charities that ‘struggle to be heard’.</p><p data-characters=490 data-current-count=490 data-injectable=true>Tom’s also known for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the sweet birthday posts that he and his girlfriend Zendaya</a> exchange over Instagram. This year, she opted to post a simple Instagram story composed of candid shots. The two have become something of a power couple for their younger Gen Z fans, who find their connection to be endearing and something to strive towards. It also helps that they’re a fashionable couple – seriously, take a look at the prior photo and tell me Tom doesn’t have style.</p><p data-characters=746 data-current-count=746 data-injectable=false>While Tom appears to be happily celebrating his birthday, he’ll likely soon be busy with press for his upcoming television show, The Crowded Room. The series premieres on Apple TV Plus on June 9, when the first three episodes are scheduled to drop, with the next seven set to air weekly. The role will be a departure from Holland’s previous work; in The Crowded Room, Holland will be portraying a character inspired by a real-life serial assaulter. Set in the ’70s, the psychological thriller follows an investigator as they look into the mystery behind Holland’s character. Also set to star in the series are Amanda Seyfried and Emmy Rossum, who’s set to play Holland’s mother in flashbacks to his childhood.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TBsLmMoaalpJGjsW7Ax5qlpKtdm66vv4yfpqtlkp6%2FtbTDmrBmr5motaa%2FjLCgraBdqbWmedKer6Kdo6l6sbXCrayrnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
