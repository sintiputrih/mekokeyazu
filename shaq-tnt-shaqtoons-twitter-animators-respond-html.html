Yesterday, Gold Bond spokesperson Shaquille O’Neal tweeted about a new contest titled “Shaqtoons,” which sounds like, essentially, a spec contest for animators for the chance to have their work featured on Shaq’s upcoming TNT docuseries Shaq Life, which was <a href=#>ordered by the network back in May</a>.

Only a lucky winner would be paid for their time, and the pay would only be $500. Beyond that, any animators who submit agree to give Turner the right to use their “name, likeness, and comments for advertising and publicity purposes, without payment of any compensation.” The terms also include a clause that those who submit waive their right to make complaints against Turner for reasons “including, but not limited to, defamation and violation of the intellectual property rights or rights of publicity or privacy.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjzwwjbcf00623h667lwyh0jo@published data-word-count=7>Here’s just a sampling of the response:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Pay an artist.

Put in perspective with the $500 a major television network was offering just to the winner — with the rest giving up their free work to be owned by a network that didn’t even pay for it — it’s not a great look. Thankfully, a quick glance at the replies to Shaq’s initial tweet confirms that most people weren’t falling for it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjzwymgfr00153h666zpb9tew@published data-word-count=52>That eventually led to an update from Shaq today, where he confronted the criticism: “To all my animators out there, I heard you. I love your work and want you to feel the love.” He also announced that the pay for the winning animation would be bumped up from $500 to $10,000:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>To all my animators out there, I heard you.

But this whole saga is at least an indication that Shaq was listening, and that when enough animators band together against exploitation, at least a little change is possible.</p><h3 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h3><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cjsyynvwm00qh1jye722pk2dw@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>People Are Dunking on Adult Swim’s Call for Free TV Show Pitches</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cjwwifp1z00ceqfyeomda15nt@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>The Six-Year Struggle to Regain Ownership of the ‘This Is Fine’ Dog</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Shaq Asks for Free Animation Work, Gets Dunked On</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlocmdgbXy0tMCqZK2mpGLAqa3QraaopqNiwbi1062cq2WRo7aurdOoqaxloprAsbvNnWWhrJ2h</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
