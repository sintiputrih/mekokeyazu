This includes queen bee Regina (Reneé Rapp) and “too gay to function” Damian (Jaquel Spivey).</p><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=245 data-injectable=false>However, other characters have been plucked from all over the entertainment world, including that of Aaron Samuels, the love interest for main character Cady (Angourie Rice, who rose to prominence with an excellent performance in The Nice Guys).</p><p data-characters=203 data-current-count=448 data-injectable=true>So, who’s the heartthrob that’s set to play the guy so good looking he has the two most popular girls in school fight over him?

On that show he played a character called Conrad, who also happened to be the main character’s love interest (we’re sensing a pattern here).</p><p data-characters=498 data-current-count=779 data-injectable=true>In the original Mean Girls, Aaron was a kind-hearted senior who, according to Regina at least, cared too much about his friends, his grades, and his mom. He was also an athlete, and was voted the King of the Spring Fling at the end of the film. Cady only meets him as she’s been placed in advanced math classes with the seniors. Although she is much better than him at the subject, she pretends to be dumb so he’ll tutor her, giving them some alone time and causing tension with Regina.</p><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=286 data-injectable=false>Aaron is a pretty good dude in the 2004 film, so we’re hoping that he’s kept his positive personality in the refresh. And, while we love Bennett’s version of the character, we’re sure an actor as talented as Briney will give us a similarly memorable performance.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGnXaW5osXSZpiaqp%2BjerStzK6cpatdnrtuucSapWafmae5tHmRaWltZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
