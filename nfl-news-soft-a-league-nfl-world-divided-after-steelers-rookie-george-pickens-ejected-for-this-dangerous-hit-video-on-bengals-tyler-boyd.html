The team has won just three games out of the 10 they have played since the start of the 2022 season. And a playoff spot for one of the leagueâ€™s most successful franchises looks far out of reach. And the Pickens ejection just epitomizes the struggling franchise.</span></p><p><span>The Steelersâ€™ defense just couldnâ€™t control the Bengals QB <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Joe Burrow</a>. Even though the defense intercepted two of Burrowâ€™s 39 pass attempts, the QB managed to throw four touchdown passes.

The Bengals are in a race to the top with the 7-3 <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Baltimore Ravens</a>. The team from Pittsburgh is just struggling at the bottom. Can the Bengals carry on with the momentum and make back-to-back Super Bowl appearances.
