I feel like I’m the last person to have a podcast. I couldn’t really see a way to do it for a while. I had to have an idea for it, I don’t want it to just be me talking on Zoom to people that I met once,” he said. “Eventually, I came up with the idea for this one. This makes me feel good.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>The Moment Craig Ferguson Almost Lost His Job Sticking Up For Britney Spears</a></span></p><p>Among Craig's recent guests on the podcast included an entertaining conversation along Diedrich Bader.

As a member of the WGA, SAG-AFTRA and the DGA, <a href=#>Craig was behind the writers</a>, and was among those in Hollywood push the studios towards a deal.</p><p>He said with Deadline, “I support the strike wholeheartedly."</p><p>"You have one job as a producer and that’s to make a deal. That’s really the whole ethos of being a producer and they’re not making a deal, and I can’t understand that. Any good producer finds a way to make a deal that everyone walks away feeling kind of good about so I can’t imagine why an association of producers can’t get together with a bunch of people who want to work and say, ‘All right, we have to find a deal’.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ferguson continued on mentioning that the strike felt different compared to his days on TV when another strike emerged during the 2007/2008 campaign.</p><p>“If I think back, it was not about a seismic change in the industry. It was about unfairness. Strikes are always about unfairness, but I think that this one is about a real change. There’s a real shift, it’s like sound coming to the movies. It’s a big deal,” he said.</p><p>As for Ferguson keeping up with late night TV since his departure, the former host revealed he hasn't kept up but in fairness, he didn't keep up when he was in the spotlight either.</p><p>“I’ll be honest with you, I didn’t watch late night before I was doing it. I certainly didn’t watch it when I was doing it. and I don’t watch it now. It’s a weird thing, it’s kind of like snooker to me. I never watched snooker on TV. I’m happy to play it, but I’m not going to watch it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fair enough, Craig!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8bq%2FRmqCgZZaav6jB0qilZmpgZ4Bw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
