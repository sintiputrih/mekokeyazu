There are plenty of other Yellowstone offerings out there, with five spin-offs and counting, but nothing will quite fill the void Yellowstone is set to leave behind.</p><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false>Thankfully, there are a few solutions. It’ll probably take awhile for the sting to fade, but news of a brand-new spin-off (which, yes, brings the count up to six) is helping to perk up disappointed fans of the franchise. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew McConaughey</a> has already been tapped to lead the new, unnamed series, and the Yellowstone universe has a proven track record <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">when it comes to spin-offs</a>.</p><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=671 data-injectable=true>If that’s not enough to ease the pain of losing Yellowstone, fans can always buy up the first half of season 5 and binge it to their heart’s content. It’s certainly a cheaper option than traveling out to Montana to visit the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">real-life Yellowstone Ranch</a> for yourself.</p><h2 id=h-yellowstone-season-5-purchase-options data-injectable=false>Yellowstone season 5 purchase options</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=466 data-current-count=766 data-injectable=true>The first half of Yellowstone‘s final season is officially available to purchase on DVD. While plenty of people veer toward streaming and digital purchases these days, a good hard copy is still widely sought after, particularly among fans who want a full collection of Yellowstone seasons to display. There’s also the matter of season 5’s delayed release to streaming, which leaves impatient fans with little option but to seek out a physical copy.</p><p data-characters=502 data-current-count=502 data-injectable=false>A variety of retailers — both online and in person — currently have season 5 of Yellowstone available for purchase. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon</a>, Target, and Walmart are all selling the first half of season 5 for the same general price — just under $20 — but buyers with deeper wallets can also buy a copy from Best Buy or Barnes & Noble. You can also hold off until the second half of the season arrives later this year, and just drop the extra cash required to add a boxed set of the series to your collection.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMSrnGasn2KvtsWMspylpJ%2BswLW7zZ5krJ2RqLyveZRmpqdllKuxcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
