It was also alleged that the restaurant that the K-pop star was at was owned by someone with a Jewish background, which could have made the situation worse if that were true.</p><p data-characters=483 data-current-count=815 data-injectable=true>The t-shirt in question was a Sid Vicious “Action Man” Sex Pistols shirt that was distributed between the 1970s and ’80s. These shirts are rare, with eBay listings ranging as low as $500. The shirt shows Sex Pistols member Sid Vicious wearing a shirt that featured the symbol that was heavily associated with Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party. At the same time, people pointed out some of Sid Vicious’ controversies, such as the alleged murder of Nancy Spungen.</p><p data-characters=535 data-current-count=535 data-injectable=true>The aforementioned apology caused a split among fans. Some believe that these idols need to be more aware of the people and symbols that are printed on their shirts. Others don’t buy the apology because they find it hard to believe that someone would be unaware of what the symbol meant. Meanwhile, others were shocked that the K-pop idol was unaware of the symbol that was on the shirt. But some defended her, claiming that she may have thought the symbol was the one used in religion, not the one that’s tied to politics.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>that's sid vicious on her shirt who played bass for a group in the 70s and he used to wear the Nazi symbol as shock value plus he literally killed his gf.
