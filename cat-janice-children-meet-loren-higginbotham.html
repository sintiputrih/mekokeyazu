The following year saw the publication of her more southern rock-influenced second album, Fire.</p><p>In the category of Best Rock Artist, Janice took home a 2019 Washington Area Music Award (WAMMY). A 2020 edition of “Selling Sunset” used the song “Pricey” by Janice. She performed a different song on the “Redneck Island” program on Country Music Television.</p><p>Janice was diagnosed with a rare aggressive form of malignant tumor in her scalene muscle in 2022 after discovering a bump in her neck.</p><p>In addition to earning a master’s degree in coastal geology and working as a geospatial information scientist, Janice was also producing and performing her own music at the time.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Janice underwent chemotherapy and surgery to remove the tumor. While receiving therapy, she worked on her album Modern Medicine. “Wishing I Was You” is a song that Janice wrote about her chemotherapy and cancer.</p><p>The music video for the song included her son. In January 2023, her single “Chill the Fck Out” was published. It talks about feeling stressed out and overwhelmed.</p><p>Janice’s physicians declared her cancer-free the following year, but the disease returned to her lungs a few months later. A few months after Janice began chemotherapy, “Modern Medicine” was released.</p><p>In the summer of 2023, she gave a performance with SOJA at the Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts. Knowing she wouldn’t have much time left, Janice got engaged to her fiancé Kyle Higginbotham in August of that year. The two were married in December.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/01081817/cat-janice-dies-last-song-son-1024x576-1.jpg><p>Four days after starting hospice care, Janice posted her song “Dance You Outta My Head” on TikTok on January 19, 2024. The song, which was co-written by Max Vernon, is about putting oneself forward, getting out, and choosing to just dance one’s problems away.</p><p>In an attempt to get the music out faster, Janice chose to release it independently rather than via her regular record label. She stated on the internet, “I believe I’m being called home.</p><p>My final happiness would be if you streamed and pre-saved my song, “Dance You Outta My Head,” which is available in my bio. All earnings go directly to my 7-year-old kid, whom I am leaving behind.”</p><p>Janice gave her son the rights to all of her songs. The sentence “Dance until you love me” that she and her son haphazardly shouted over and over while out for a drive one day served as the basis for the song.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/01081755/72402458007-cat-janice-and-loren-1024x576.webp?resize=770%2C433&ssl=1"><p>“Dance You Outta My Head” peaked at number 37 on Billboard’s Hot Dance/Electronic Songs two weeks after its release. The song also made its debut at number 11 on the overall Digital Song Sales chart and number 2 on Billboard’s Dance/Electronic Digital Song Sales chart.</p><p>On February 17, it peaked at number one on the TikTok Billboard Top 50. The song peaked at number seven on iTunes globally, number one in Romania, Ireland, and the Czech Republic, and number twelve in the US. The ASCAP Foundation awarded the song the Robert Allen Award.</p><p><strong>Source: <a href=# rel=noopener>www.Ghgossip.com</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jpyYrWWalruqr8RmmqGhnJm%2FprqMppyerF2hvLOxzWafop%2BXnruju9OhmKZn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
