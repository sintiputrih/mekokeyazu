He helped guide me through my first Session as my Legislative Aide and proved to be smart, hard-working, and passionate about serving. But what I’ll remember most about him is our friendship in the years after and our long conversations about politics and life. Shawn’s kindness, generosity, and willingness to help others touched so many people. He had a bright future ahead of him, but in his short time with us he made our futures brighter with all that he did professionally and personally. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends. He will be sorely missed.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114 data-inserter-version=2></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiqkZ%2ButLDEp6uapJOkua2xxp5lnKedZLWww4ydoJ1lo52uuLqMrKaaqpWoeqW1xGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
