Thank you?? It’s just not enough, and often, I can’t find the words that would describe the love of our connection and admiration that I have for a child. My child. God chose you, especially for me. To make me laugh, to keep me sane, to keep me grinding and growing to keep me loving and forgiving and focused. I love you Beans. And Six years ago, We gave birth to each other. You are the best thing that ever happened to me. Thank you, son, for being who you are. My BEST Friend!! PHOTO CREDIT ~>> @kingladybug 💕💕🥰🥰🥰🥰 #Loganis6.”</p><p>She continued with: “My Beans🥰 #loganis6 thanks Vince for the BEST thing EVER 😩😩🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😌 @kingladybug.”</p><p>David Adefeso, who is Tamar’s boyfriend, added: “Awwwww❤️❤️ that’s the sweetest message ❤️❤️@tamarbraxton👏🏾👏🏾. Happy 6th birthday Logan🥁🥁💥💥. Many more to come🙏🏽🙏🏽.”</p><p>Tamar was forced to close her comment section because she is being destroyed for her behavior on the season finale of Braxton Family Values where she was rude to her sisters and David.</p><p>A critic said: “Girl, seriously you were acting like a big ass spoiled child 🙄 on tonight’s episode for real. And if you continue to treat that grown ass man like a child, you will lose him😏. I can’t believe he even let you treat him like that 🤔. I have never seen a forty-something-year-old woman act like such a child in my life, and it is a bad example for your son!!! Learn to do this 🤐🤐🤐.”</p><p>Another TV viewer wrote: “I pray your son’s woman doesn’t treat you like you handled your man. You’re a hurt, angry, abused woman full of unforgiveness.”</p><p>This Instagrammer shared: “First, off Tamar, you are very disrespectful toward Tracy, and David you are so Ridiculous out of control like Tracy committed you to make it hard for someone to you love you need to stop you think people support your Childress behavior.”</p><p>A fourth person wrote: “TRIFLING!!!! If it’s not all about YOU, you’re out of there. PETULANT CHILD. You keep covering your boyfriend’s mouth like that, telling him not to speak, you’re going to lose him.🙄 He’s really PW’d, wow. Why couldn’t you muster enough love for your sister to congratulate her? What is wrong with you? Shame on you! 🤮🤮🤮🙄🙄”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Tamar is moving ahead with still more life lessons to learn.</p><span><a href=# rel=prev><img width=150 height=27 alt="Next Article" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></span><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeklrqivoybqZqwpKS7br%2FHmqmeq12isrS%2FwKCcZpmemXqxtM6tpmasmJa7rLXNoGSvoZ6Ysq%2FAjKGcq5qVp8Fuss6rZKynnmK5sLPAp2Sopl2dtrR5la2fZpqZp8GpsMCyZKGdopp6qr%2BMsJ%2ByZZSWw6qwjJqbnp6VqLy0ecaiqaWeop6yr7CMmqOsp12cvLV5wpqjpZ2UYr%2B2sMRmmbJlmJq%2FbrLAp6pmamllfXGBjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
