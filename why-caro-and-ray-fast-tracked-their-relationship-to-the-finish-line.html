However, they did not return for the second round of filming.</p><p>Both former Love Island USA contestants, Ray is now an aspiring dentist based across New Jersey and New York City, while Caro has been focusing on being an influencer and <a href=#>YouTuber</a> since the show.</p><p>Caro, 23, is from Los Angeles and Ray, 25, first met on Love Island USA Season 1 where they finished in third place. They are also used to traveling long distances, considering they are currently on two different coasts.</p><p>If they took home $1million cash prize, Ray had promised to move out to Los Angeles!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>So we‚Äôre missing Anthony/Spencer, Connie/Sam, Caro/Ray, & Isaiah/Taylor? <a href=#>#AmazingRace</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/smDLsCs2VD</a></p>‚Äî Ryan ü¶à (@suRYvor) <a href=#>January 13, 2022</a></figure>View Tweet<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-caro-and-ray-s-relationship-timeline>Caro and Ray‚Äôs relationship timeline</h2><p>The former couple first met on Love Island, which saw Caro arrive first and get coupled up with Cashel Barnett. But when Cashel got into a relationship with Kyra Green, Ray arrived and instantly caught Caro‚Äôs eye.</p><p>It wasn‚Äôt long before she thought she had met her soulmate, with Caro and Ray sharing several intimate moments throughout the series. Although they didn‚Äôt win, the pair did go on to make the final.</p><p>After, Caro and Ray were the couple to last the longest after their season, but they broke up sometime around July 2020.

She revealed in a <a href=#>July 2020 YouTube video</a> that they had split up.</p><p>She said:</p><p>We‚Äôre not dating anymore. It is sad because I do want to clarify that I really tried my hardest in this relationship, and I just don‚Äôt want to throw anybody under the bus. I don‚Äôt want to make my business be everybody‚Äôs business, but I guess I am because this is a YouTube video.</p><p>Caro and Ray had broken up some time after filming was paused during the outbreak of Covid-19. As many will be aware, they are not the first couple to be affected by the pandemic, as this meant they could not see each other.</p><p>Due to already having a long-distance relationship, it is likely that the stresses of not being able to meet may have influenced their decision to break up. Despite this, Ray still speaks highly of Caro.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by R A Y (@raygantt)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<p class=has-text-align-center>WATCH THE AMAZING RACE ON CBS AND PARAMOUNT PLUS FROM WEDNESDAY JANUARY 5TH AT 8/7C</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>INSTAGRAM</a> AND <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>FACEBOOK</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfmK%2B0e9ahsGabkae8bq3NnWSrmalis6K%2F02arq5mToLKledOhnKKqXaeyra3Toqanq5ievW7AzmaroZ1dm7avtdKhZKWhnpo%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
