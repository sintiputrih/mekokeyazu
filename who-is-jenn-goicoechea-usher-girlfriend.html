They sealed the deal a few months later, when they were photographed kissing backstage at the Hollywood Bowl in October 2019. And they made their official debut in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.ajc.com/entertainment/usher-and-girlfriend-jenn-goicoechea-snuggle-diddy-50th-birthday-bash/xhGTrSY0XVe9SPiAddWCqO/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="December 2019" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>December 2019</u></a>, when they attended Sean “Diddy” Combs’s birthday in Los Angeles, where Usher was performing.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">They have two kids.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Goicoechea and Usher welcomed their first child, daughter Sovereign Bo, on September 24, 2020.
